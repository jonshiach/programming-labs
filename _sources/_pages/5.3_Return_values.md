# Return values

The majority of functions output (or **return**) an object or a tuple of multiple objects. To return something from a function we use the `return` command.

```python
def function(argument1, argument2, ...)
    commands
    return output
```

```{important}
The when the `return` command is encountered the function terminates and any indented code following it will not be executed. 
```

To demonstrate this enter the following code into your program.

```python
# Return values
def double(x):
    return 2 * x


print("\nReturn values\n-----------")
print(double(3))
print(double(5))
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Return values
-----------
6
10
```

## Multiple return values

We can return multiple values from a function by listing them after the `return` command.

```text
def function(argument1, argument2, ...)
    commands
    return output1, output2, ...
```

To demonstrate this lets write a function calculates the volume and surface area of a cylinder. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
# Multiple return values
import numpy as np

def cylinder(radius, height):
    volume = height * np.pi * radius ** 2
    surface_area = height * 2 * np.pi * radius
    
    return volume, surface_area


vol, area = cylinder(1, 2)

print("\nMultiple return values\n--------------")
print(f"Volume      : {vol:8.4f}")
print(f"Surface area: {area:8.4f}")
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Multiple return values
--------------
Volume      :   6.2832 units^3
Surface area:  12.5664 units^2
```

## Exercises

```{exercise}
:label: functions-exercise-5

Write a function called `norm()` that calculates the norm (magnitude) of a vector of unknown length. Use your function to calculate

1. $|(1, 2, 3)|$
2. $|(4, 5, 6, 7)|$

```

Euclid's algorithm for computing the *greatest common divisor (GCD)* of two numbers $x$ and $y$ is

1. Find the remainder $r$ of ${x}\div{y}$
2. Set $x = y$ and $y = r$
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until $y = 0$ then the GCD is $x$

Write a function called `gcd()` that returns the GCD of two numbers. Use your function to calculate the GCD of:

1. 14 and 245
2. 2414 and 54145
```

The following sequence converges to the square root of a positive number $x$

$$ x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2} \left( x_n + \frac{x}{x_n} \right), $$

where $x_0 = 0$ and $x_1 = 1$. Define a function called `sqrt()` that calculates numbers in this sequence until the difference two successive numbers is less that $5 \times 10^{-5}$. Use your function to calculate

1. $\sqrt{144}$
2. $\sqrt{12345}$
