# Classes

A class in Python is declared using the <a href="https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/classdef.html" target="_blank">`classdef`</a> keyword.

```matlab
classdef Class_name
    properties (Attributes) ... end
    methods (Attributes) ... end
```

Where `Class_name` is the name of the class and `properties` is a list of the class properties (known as *attributes* in Python). 

```{important}
A MATLAB class must be declared in its own .m file with the same name as the class.
```

Once a class has been declared an object of the class is creates using

```matlab
object_name = Class_name
```

The properties of an object are accessed using

```matlab
object_name.property
```

Lets create a class for members of the university. Create a new MATLAB file called  **Member.m** and enter the following code.

```matlab
classdef Member
    properties
        name = "Joel Miller"
        ID = 12345678
    end
end
```

Here we have declared a class called `Member` which has two attributes `name` and `ID` which we set to a string and an integer. Create another new MATLAB file called **M14_Object_orientated_programming.m** and save it to your OneDrive folder and enter the following code.

```matlab
% =========================================================================
% 14. Object Orientated Programming
% =========================================================================

fprintf("\n14. Object Orientated Programming\n---------------------------------\n")

% 14.1 Classes
joel = Member;

fprintf("\n14.1 Classes\n------------\n")
fprintf("%s\n", joel.name)
fprintf("%d\n", joel.ID)
```

Here we have created an object called `joel` and print the values of the properties. Run your program and the you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
14. Object Orientated Programming
---------------------------------

14.1 Classes
------------
Joel Miller
12345678
```

## Changing the attributes

Lets create another object of our `Member` class and print out the attributes. Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
% 14.1.1 Changing the properties
ellie = Member;

fprintf("\n14.1.1 Changing the properties\n------------------------------\n")
fprintf("%s\n", ellie.name)
fprintf("%d\n", ellie.ID)
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
14.1.1 Changing the properties
------------------------------
Joel Miller
12345678
```

These details are incorrect for our `ellie` object. To change the values of the attributes we simply access the attributes of the object and set their values. Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
ellie.name = "Ellie Williams";
ellie.ID = 24123456;

fprintf("\n")
fprintf("%s\n", ellie.name)
fprintf("%d\n", ellie.ID)
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
Ellie Williams
24123456
```

## Constructors

Changing the attributes whenever we want to create a new object is a bit cumbersome. Fortunately in MATLAB we have a constructor method (a method is a function that belongs to a class) that is called whenever a new object is created. Constructors are useful for setting the values of attributes and performing any initialisation routines. The MATLAB syntax for a constructor is

```matlab
methods
    function obj = Class_name(argument1, argument2, ...)
        % commands
    end
```

Where `obj` is parameter that is the reference to the current instance of the class. Lets declare a constructor to assign the attributes to inputted values. Edit your **Member.m** file so that it looks like the following.

```matlab
classdef Member
    properties
        name = "Joel Miller"
        ID = 12345678
    end

    methods
        function obj = Member(name, ID)
            if nargin == 2
                obj.name = name;
                obj.ID = ID;
            end
        end
    end
end
```

Here we have added a constructor method that takes inputs of `name` and `ID` and assigns them to the appropriate properties. Note that the constructor checks to see if two input arguments have been given so that we can still create objects with no input arguments. In your **M14_Object_orientated_programming.m** file enter the following code.

```matlab
% 14.1.2 Constructors
tommy = Member("Tommy Miller", 87654321);

fprintf("\n14.1.2 Constructors\n-------------------\n")
fprintf("%s\n", tommy.name)
fprintf("%d\n", tommy.ID)
```

Here we have created a new object `tommy` with its properties. Run your program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text

14.1.2 Constructors
-------------------
Tommy Miller
87654321
```

## Exercises

```{exercise}
:label: matlab-oop-exercise-1

Create a class called `Vehicle` with a constructor that initialises the attributes `name` and `max_speed`. Create the following objects of the `Vehicle` class and print the values of the attributes.

1. `delorean`: name is `Delorean` and maximum speed is 110
2. `batmobile` name is `Batmobile` and maximum speed is 330
```

```{exercise}
:label: matlab-oop-exercise-2

Create a class called `Shape` with a constructor that initialises the attributes `name` and `number_of_edges`. Create objects for the following shapes and print the values of the attributes.

1. a triangle
2. a rectangle
3. a circle
```
