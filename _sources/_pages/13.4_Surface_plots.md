# Surface plots

Surface plots can then be generated using the `surf()` function

```matlab
surf(X, Y, Z)
```

where `X`, `Y` and `Z` are 2D co-ordinate arrays. To produce a surface plot of the bi-variate function $z=f(x,y)$ we require $x$ and $y$ co-ordinates in the domain. The `meshgrid()` function is useful for generating these.

```matlab
X, Y = meshgrid(x, y)
```

This generates two 2D arrays `X` and `Y` from two 1D arrays `x` and `y`. `X` contains the elements of `x` arranged in rows and `Y` contains the elements of `y` arranged in columns. To demonstrate this enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
% Meshgrid
x = linspace(0, 4, 5);
y = linspace(0, 3, 4);
[X, Y] = meshgrid(x, y);
x
y
X
Y
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
x =

     0     1     2     3     4


y =

     0     1     2     3


X =

     0     1     2     3     4
     0     1     2     3     4
     0     1     2     3     4
     0     1     2     3     4


Y =

     0     0     0     0     0
     1     1     1     1     1
     2     2     2     2     2
     3     3     3     3     3
```

Lets produce a surface plot of the bi-variate function $f(x, y) = \sin(\pi x) + \cos(\pi y)$ for $x, y \in [-1, 1]$. Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
% Surface plots
x = linspace(-1, 1, 30);
y = linspace(-1, 1, 30);
[X, Y] = meshgrid(x, y);
Z = sin(pi * X) .* sin(pi * Y);

clf
surf(X, Y, Z)
xlabel('$x$', FontSize=16, Interpreter='latex')
ylabel('$y$', FontSize=16, Interpreter='latex')
title('$f(x,y) = \sin(\pi x)\sin(\pi y)$', FontSize=20, Interpreter='latex')
```

Run your program and you should see the following plot added to the plot window.

## Colormaps

We can add colours to a surface plot in the form of a **colormap** where the color used for the surface is based on some value, e.g., the height. A colormap can be added to a surface plot using the `colormap()` function. The surface plot above uses the default MATLAB colormap which is `jet`. 

```matlab
colormap(name_of_colormap)
```

where `name_of_colormap` is the name of the colormap to be applied (see <a href="https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/colormap.html" target="_blank">MATLAB Help Center</a> for a list of these). Lets demonstrate this by applying the `winter` colormap to our surface plot, enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
colormap(winter)
```

Run your program and you should see the following plot added to the plot window.

```{figure} ../_images/13_Surface_plot_2.png
:width: 400
```

## Line colour

The default line colour for MATLAB surface plots is black which is fine for the majority of plots. However, the line colour can be changed if needed using the `EdgeColor` property

```matlab
surf(X, Y, Z, EdgeColor='colour')
```

Lets change the line colour of our surface plot to white, change your code so that the plotting command looks like the following.

```matlab
surf(X, Y, Z, EdgeColor='w')
```

Run your program and you should see the following plot added to the plot window.

```{figure} ../_images/13_Surface_plot_3.png
:width: 400
```

## View angle

With 3D plots we can control the position of the viewpoint using the `view_init()` function

```matlab
view(elevation, azimuth)
```

where `elevation` and `azimuth` are the angles (in degrees) that specify the vertical and horizontal position of the viewpoint relative to the centre of view ({numref}`matlab-azimuth-and-elevation-figure`).

```{figure} https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/view_diagram.png

:name: matlab-azimuth-and-elevation-figure
:alt: Azimuth and elevation diagram

Azimuth and elevation angles (from <a href="https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/view.html?searchHighlight=view&s_tid=srchtitle_support_results_1_view" target="_blank">MATLAB Help Center</a>)
```

Lets view our surface plot from an azimuth angle of 30$^\circ$ and an elevation of 20$^\circ$. Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
% View angle
view_init(20, 30)
```

Run your program and you should see the following plot added to the plot window.

```{figure} ../_images/13_Surface_plot_4.png

## Exercise

```{exercise}
:label: matlab-surface-plots-ex1

Produce a surface plot of the function $f(x, y) = \exp(-20((x - 0.5)^2 + (y - 0.5)^2))$ over the domain $x,y \in [0, 1]$ using the `autumn` colormap.
