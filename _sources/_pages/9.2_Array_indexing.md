# Array Indexing

The elements of an array are <a href="https://jonshiach.github.io/LA-book/1_Matrices/1.0_Matrices.html#indexing-a-matrix" target="_blank">indexed</a> by their position **starting at 1 for the first element**. The index is written in rounded brackets following the array name, e.g., to access the element $a_i$ of the 1D array `a` we use

```text
a(i)
```

For two-dimensional arrays, the indices of an element are separated by a comma, e.g., to access the element $a_{ij}$ of the 2D array `A` we use

```text
array(i,j)
```

To index elements at the end of a row or column we can use the index `end`.

```text
array(end)
```

Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
% 9.2 Array indexing
fprintf("\n9.2 Array indexing\n------------------\n")
fprintf("The first element in a is %d \n", a(1))
fprintf("The second element in a is %d \n", a(2))
fprintf("The last element in a is %d \n", a(end))
fprintf("The element in row 1 column 1 of A is %d \n", A(1,1))
fprintf("The element in row 2 column 1 of A is %d \n", A(2, 1))
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
9.2 Array indexing
------------------
The first element in a is 1 
The second element in a is 2 
The last element in a is 3 
The element in row 1 column 1 of A is 1 
The element in row 2 column 1 of A is 3 
```

## Determining the size of an array

The number of elements in a one-dimensional array can be determined using the `length()` function

```matlab
length(array)
```

The number of rows and columns in a 2D array can be determined using the `size()` function

```text
rows = size(array, 1)
cols = size(array, 2)
```

Enter the following code into your program.

```python
% 9.2.1 Array sizes
fprintf("\n9.2.1 Array sizes\n-----------------\n")
fprintf("The 1D array a has %d elements\n", length(a))
fprintf("The 2D array A has %d rows and %d columns\n", size(A, 1), size(A, 2))
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
2.3.1 Array sizes
-----------------
The 1D array a has 3 elements
The 2D array A has 2 rows and 2 columns
```

## Array slicing

Sometimes we want to access multiple elements of an array at the same times. To do this we can use **array slicing**. This is done by specifying a range for the elements we want to access

```text
array(start : stop : step]
```

`start` is the index of the first element in the range, `stop` is **1 more than** the index of the last element in the range and `step` is the difference between the indices. If any these are unspecified Python uses default values of `start = 0`, `stop = array length`, `step = 1`.

To print the first 4 elements of `b` we use `start = 1`, `stop = 4` and `step = 1`. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
% 9.2.2 Array slicing
fprintf("\n9.2.2 Array slicing\n-------------------\n")
fprintf("The first 4 elements of b are")
b(1:1:4)
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
9.2.2 Array slicing
-------------------
The first 4 elements of b are
ans =

     1     2     3     4
```

Since MATLAB uses the default value `step = 1` so we don't need to specify the `step` value. Replace `b(1:1:4)` with `b(1:4)` and rerun your program, you should see that the output has not changed.

To print the last 5 elements of `b` we use `start = 4` and `stop = 9` (the length of the array). But since the default `stop` value is the length of the array we don't need to specify this. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
fprintf("The last 5 elements of b are")
b(5:end)
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
The last 5 elements of b are
ans =

     5     6     7     8     9
```

To print the middle 3 elements of `b` we use `start = 4` (since array indexing starts at 0 this is the 4th element of `b`) and `stop = 6` (as we want a step of 1 we don't need to specify this). Enter the following code to your program. 

```python
fprintf("The middle three elements of b are")
b(4:6)
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
The middle three elements of b are
ans =

     4     5     6
```

To print all of the elements of `b` with an even number index we use `start = 2`, `stop = 9` and `step = 2`. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
fprintf("The elements of b with even indices are")
b(2:2:end)
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
The elements of b with even indices are
ans =

     2     4     6     8
```

To print all of the elements of `b` in reverse order we can use `start = end`, `stop = 1` and `step = -1`. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
fprintf("The elements of b in reverse order are")
b(end:-1:1)
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
The elements of b in reverse order are
ans =

     9     8     7     6     5     4     3     2     1
```

### Slicing 2D arrays

Slicing of 2D arrays is similar to that for 1D arrays with the exception that it needs to be done for both dimensions. Lets say we want to print the first row of the 2D array `C`. The first dimension specifies the row index we for us this is 1. The second dimension is the column index and since we want all elements in the row we have `start = 1`, `stop = end` and `step = 1` which we can use default values for these which leaves a single `:`. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
fprintf("The first row of A is")
A(1,:)
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
The first row of A is
ans =

     1     2
```

Lets do similar for the second column of `A`. Here we output all elements in the first dimension and use the column index 2. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
fprintf("The second column of A is")
A(:,2)
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the console output.

```text
The second column of A is
ans =

     2
     4
```
