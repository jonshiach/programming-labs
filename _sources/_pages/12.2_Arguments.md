# Arguments

We can pass information to a function in the form of **arguments**. When a function is declared, the input arguments are listed inside the brackets and separated by commas.

```matlab
function function_name(argument)

% commands

end
```

To demonstrate this, enter the following code into the end of your program

```matlab
function print_age(age)

fprintf("Age : %d \n", age)

end
```

and make a call to this function by entering the following code before the function declarations.

```matlab
% 12.2 Function arguments
fprintf("\n12.2 Function arguments\n-----------------------\n")
print_age(19)
```

Here we have declared a function called `print_age()` that has a single input argument `age`. We then call this function specifying the input value 19. Run your program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
12.2 Function arguments
-----------------------
Age : 19 
```

Lets say that Ellie has survived for another year and is now 20. To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

```python
print_age(20)
```

Rerun your program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
Age : 20
```

So we can see that the value of the argument is used by the `fprintf()` command in the function.

## Multiple arguments

A MATLAB function can have any number of arguments which are listed in the brackets separated by commas.

```matlab
function function_name(argument1, argument2, ...)

% commands

end
```

To demonstrate this, enter the following code into the end of your program

```matlab
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
function print_name_and_age(first_name, last_name, age)

fprintf("Name : %s %s\n", first_name, last_name)
fprintf("Age  : %d\n", age)

end
```

and make a call to this function by entering the following code before the function declarations. Run your program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
12.2.1 Multiple arguments
-------------------------
Name : Joel Miller
Age  : 56
```

---

## Arbitrary arguments

If you don't know how many arguments will be passed into your function we can use **arbitrary arguments** using the `varargin` keyword as the input argument. This means that the arbitrary argument will be a *tuple* (an ordered set of objects).

```python
function function_name(varargin)

% commands

end
```

The individual elements in `varargin` can be accessed using `varargin{index}` and the number of elements in `varargin` is stored in `nargin`. To demonstrate this, enter the following code into the end of your program.

```matlab
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
function print_names(varargin)

for i = 1 : nargin
    fprintf("%s\n", varargin{i})
end

end
```

and make a call to this function by entering the following code before the function declarations.

```matlab
% 12.2.2 Arbitrary arguments
fprintf("\n12.2.2 Arbitrary arguments\n--------------------------\n")
print_names("Ellie", "Joel")
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
5.2.2 Arbitrary arguments
-------------------------
Ellie
Joel
```

So the `print_names()` function has an arbitrary argument `names` and by passing two strings into the function both of the strings are printed. Now enter the following code into your program.

```python
print_names("Tommy", "Dina", "Jesse")
```

Rerun your program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
Tommy
Dina
Jesse
```

So we can pass any number of strings into the `print_names()` function.

```{important}
`varagin` must come after all standard arguments in the function declaration.
```

## Exercises

````{exercise}
:label: matlab-functions-exercise-2

Write a function called `odd_or_even()` that outputs a message to the command window stating whether an inputted number is odd or even. Use your function on the following:

1. 2
2. 5
3. 0
````

```{exercise}
:label: matlab-functions-exercise-3

Write a function called `isprime()` that checks whether an inputted integer is a prime and prints the result. Use your function to determine which of the following are prime:

1. 3469
2. 6137
```

```{exercise}
:label: matlab-functions-exercise-4

Write a function called `mean()` that takes in the inputs of an unknown number of values and prints the mean value. Use your function to output the mean of the following numbers correct to 4 decimal places:

1. 1, 2, 3, 4
2. 5, 3, 7, 5, 8, 2, 4, 2, 1
