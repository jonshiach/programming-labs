# Methods

A **method** is a function that belongs to a class. A method is declared within the class declaration.

```python
class Class_name:
    def method_name(self, arguments):
        commands
```

Where `self` is a parameter that refers to the current instance of the class and `arguments` are optional method arguments. Lets add a method to our `Member` class, inside the `Method` class declaration, enter the following code.

```python
def print(self):
    print("\nUniversity Member Details\n-------------------------")
    print(f"Name     : {self.name}")
    print(f"ID       : {self.ID}")
    print(f"Position : {self.position}")
```

Here we have declared a `print()` method that prints the details of the object. At the end of your program enter the following code.

```python
# 7.2 Methods
abby = Member("Abby Anderson", 24135791, "Student")

print("\n7.2 Methods\n-----------")
abby.print()
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
7.2 Methods
-----------

University Member Details
-------------------------
Name     : Abby Anderson
ID       : 24135791
Position : Student
```

```{note}
If we try to called the `print()` method on the `ellie`, `joel` or `tommy` objects Python will return an error since when those objects were created our `Member` class did not have a `print()` method. To use this method on these objects we will need to re-create them using the up-to-date class.
