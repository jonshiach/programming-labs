# Methods

A **method** is a function that belongs to a class. A method is declared within the class declaration.

```text
class Class_name:
    def method_name(self):
        commands to be executed
```

Where `self` is a parameter that refers to the current instance of the class. Lets add a method to our `Member` class, inside the `Method` class declaration, enter the following code.

```python
def print(self):
    print("\nUniversity Member Details\n-------------------------")
    print(f"Name     : {self.name}")
    print(f"ID       : {self.ID}")
```

Here we have declared a `print()` method that prints the details of the object. At the end of your program enter the following code.

```python
# Methods
abby = Member("Abby Anderson", 24135791)

print()
abby.print()
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
University Member Details
-------------------------
Name     : Abby Anderson
ID       : 24135791
```

```{note}
If we try to call the `print()` method on the `ellie`, `joel` or `tommy` objects Python will return an error since when those objects were created our `Member` class did not have a `print()` method. To use this method on these objects we will need to re-create them using the updated class declaration
```

## Exercises

```{exercise}
:label: python-methods-ex1

Add an attribute called `speed` to your `Vehicle` class from {ref}`python-classes-ex1` and set it equal to 0. Write a method called `accelerate()` that increases the speed attribute by a given amount ensuring that it doesn't exceed the maximum speed.

Use your method to accelerate the two vehicles using the following and print their speed:

1. accelerate the Delorean to 88 mph
2. accelerate the Batmobile to 150 mph
```

```{exercise}
:label: python-methods-ex2

Add a method to your `Shape` class from {ref}`python-classes-ex2` called `print()` that prints the name of the shape and the number of edges it has.
```
