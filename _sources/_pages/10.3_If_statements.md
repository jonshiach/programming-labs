# If statements

If statements are used in a program to execute commands when a certain logical condition is met. The syntax of an if statement takes the following form

```matlab
if condition
    % commands executed when true
end 
```

Note that the unlike Python, MATLAB uses the `end` keyword to denote the end of the if statement. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
% 10.3 If statements
x = 2;
y = 3;

fprintf("\n10.3 If statements\n------------------\n")
if x < y
    fprintf("%d is less than %d\n", x, y)
end
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the console output.

```text
10.3 If statements
------------------
2 is less than 3
```

---

## Else-if

Sometimes you want to perform calculations if the previous conditions were not true. We can do this using the if-else condition with the `elif` keyword.

```matlab
if condition1
    % commands executed if condition1 is true

elseif condition2
    % commands executed if condition2 is true

end
```

Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
% 10.3.1 Else-if statements
hour = 15;

fprintf("\n10.3.1 Else-if statements\n-------------------------\n")
if hour < 12
    fprintf("Good morning, how are you today? \n")
   
elseif hour < 18
    fprintf("Good afternoon, are you having a good day? \n")

end
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the console output.

```text
3.3.1. Else-if statements
-------------------------
Good afternoon, are you having a good day?
```

Try changing the value of `hour` to see the different results.

---

## Else

The `else` keyword is used to perform calculations if all previous conditions are false.

```text
if condition1:
    % commands executed if condition1 is true

elseif condition2:
    % commands executed if condition 2 is true
    
else
   % commands executed if all previous conditions are false

end
```

Add the following code to your if-else statement

```python
else
    fprintf("Good evening, did you have a good day? \n")
```

and change the value of the `hour` variable to 21. Run your program and your should see the following added to the console output.

```text
10.3.1 Else-if statements
-------------------------
Good evening, did you have a good day?
```

## Exercises

Create a new MATLAB file called **M10_If_statements_exercise.m** and save it to your OneDrive folder. Use it to answer the following exercises.

````{exercise}
:label: matlab-if-statements-exercise-1

The degree classification for an undergraduate student at Manchester Metropolitan University is determined using by calculating a weighted average of the level 5 (2nd year) and level 6 (3rd year) unit marks using the ratio 25:75 then looking up the classification in the table below.

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Weighted average
  - Degree classification
* - $\geq 70$ 
  - first class (1st)
* - $\geq 60$
  - upper second class (2:1)
* - $\geq 50$
  - lower second class (2:2)
* - $\geq 40$
  - third class (3rd)
* - $<40$
  - fail
```

For example, a student who has gained level 5 marks of 55, 45, 75, 65 and level 6 marks of 60, 74, 72, 68 has a weighted average of 66.4 and therefore will graduate with upper second class honours.

Write a program that prints the degree classification based on the level 5 and 6 marks that are stored in two arrays. Use your program to determine the degree classification of a student who has level 5 marks of 62, 65, 72, 64 and level 6 marks of 66, 73, 77, 70.

The degree classification of a student is also determined using the profile method that only uses the level 6 marks. The average of the level 6 marks and the degree classification is found by looking up the table below.

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Level 6 average
  - together with two units marks of
  - Degree classification
* - $\geq 68$
  - $\geq 70$
  - first class (1st)
* - $\geq 58$
  - $\geq 60$
  - upper second class (2:1)
* - $\geq 48$
  - $\geq 50$
  - lower second class (2:2)
* - $\geq 40$
  - $\geq 40$
  - third class (3rd)
```

The degree classification a student receives is the higher classification of the weighted average method and the profile method. 

For example, for the same student with level 6 marks of 60, 74, 72, 68 giving a level 6 average of 68.5. Since they have 2 units with marks above 70% the classification using the profile method is first class honours.

Extend your program from {ref}`matlab-if-statements-exercise-1` so that the degree classification using the profile method is determined and the final degree classification is printed. 

Hint: The `sort(x)` function sorts the array `x` into ascending order.

:label: matlab-if-statements-exercise-3

Write a program that plays the rock-paper-scissors game. Your program should select from rock, paper or scissors at random and based on a choice you have made determine who has won and prints an appropriate message to the console, e.g.,

```text
Exercise 3.3
------------
You have chosen rock
Your opponent has chosen scissors

Rock crushes scissors, you win!
```

Hint: the `randi(n)` function generates a random integer between 1 and `n`.
