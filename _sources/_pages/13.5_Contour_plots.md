# Contour plots

Contour plots show points of equal value can be produced using the `contour()` function.

```matlab
contour(X, Y, Z)
```

where `X`, `Y` and `Z` are 2D co-ordinate arrays. Lets create a contour plot of the bi-variate function $f(x, y) = \sin(\pi x)\sin(\pi y)$ that we used in the previous section on [surface plots](surface-plots-section). Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
% Contour plots
clf
contour(X, Y, Z)
xlabel('$x$', FontSize=16, Interpreter='latex')
ylabel('$y$', FontSize=16, Interpreter='latex')
```

Run your program and you should see the following plot added to the plot window.

## Contour levels

The number of contour lines that are used a draw a contour plot can be specified in the `contour()` function.

```matlab
contour(X, Y, Z, levels)
```

where `levels` is an integer. To demonstrate this enter the following code into your program before the `show()` function.

```matlab
contour(X, Y, Z, 15)
```

Here we specify that we want 15 contour lines on our contour plot. Run your program and you should see the following added to the Plots pane.

## Contour labels

Looking at our contour plots it may be difficult to see which contour lines represent the higher values. To help with this we can add labels to each of our contour lines using the `clabel()` function.

```matlab
[C, h] = contour(X, Y, Z)
clabel(C, h)
```

To demonstrate this enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
% Contour labels
clf
[C,h] = contour(X, Y, Z)
clabel(C, h)
xlabel('$x$', FontSize=16, Interpreter='latex')
ylabel('$y$', FontSize=16, Interpreter='latex')
```

Run your program and you should see the following plot added to the plot window.

```{figure} ../_images/13_Contour_plot_3.png

## Exercise

```{exercise}
:label: matplab-contour-plot-ex1

Produce a contour plot of the function $z=(z_1-z_2)^2$ where $z_1=\exp(-x^2-y^2)$ and $z_2=\exp(-(x-1)^2-(y-1)^2)$ over the domain $x,y\in[-2,3]$. 
```
