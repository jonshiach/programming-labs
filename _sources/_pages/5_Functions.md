# Functions

A **function** is a block of code that is used to perform a single action. These are very useful in programming as they allow us to think of a program as a collection of single individual tasks which helps when writing longer programs. Functions also allow us to repeat tasks easily without having to write out the individual commands again.

You have already been introduced to functions that are in the NumPy library, for example `np.cos()`.
