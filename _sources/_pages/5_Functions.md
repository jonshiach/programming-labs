# Functions

A **function** is a block of code that is used to perform a single action. These are very useful in programming as they allow us to think of a program as a collection of single individual tasks which helps when writing longer programs. Functions also allow us to repeat tasks easily without having to write out the individual commands again.

For example, imagine you are working in the university library. Your duties include helping students find books, checking books in and out and telling rowdy students to be quiet. Each of these individual tasks can be represented as a function. A function consists of the following:

- **Name**: a function is given a name that we can use to **call** the function.
- **Inputs**: Functions sometimes require inputs that determine what the function does. For example, we could have a function with the name `find_book()` that given an input of a subject finds an appropriate book on the subject. Not all functions need an input, for example, we could have another function called `shush()` that admonishes any noisy students when called.
- **Instructions**: A function contains a set of commands that are executed when the function is called. For example, we could have a function called `check_in()` that updates the library data base when book is returned an places it on the correct shelf.
- **Outputs**: Functions can produce outputs. For example, our `find_book()` function could return the details of a book, or set of books that satisfy the inputs.

We have already met some functions in Python, for example `print()` and `np.append()`.
