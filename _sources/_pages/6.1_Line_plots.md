# Line Plots

To plot a simple two-dimensional function we can use the <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html" target="_blank">`plt.plot`</a> command.

```python
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

where `x` and `y` are one-dimensional arrays. The values of `x` can be generated using the the NumPy function  <a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html" target="_blank">`np.linspace()`</a>. The `plt.show()` command tells Python to display the plot, without it only the last plot in the program will be shown.

```python
x = np.linspace(start, end, numvals)
```

This creates an array `x` with `numvals` equally spaced values between `start` and `end` inclusive. Lets create a graph of the function $y = x^2$. Create a new Python file called **6_Plotting.py** and save it in your OneDrive folder. Enter the following code into your file.

```python
# =============================================================================
# 6. Plotting
# =============================================================================

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Line plot
x = np.linspace(-2, 2, 10)
y = x ** 2

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

Run your program and you will see that nothing has been added to the console. To view the plot open the Plots pane by clicking on **Plots** beneath the top-right pane. You should see the following plot.

```{figure} ../_images/6_Line_plot_1.png
:width: 500
```

We can see that our line plot appears jagged where is should be a smooth line. This is because we have only generated 10 points in our `x` array. To make the plot appear smoother we simply increase the number of points that we are plotting. To demonstrate this change your code so that it looks like the following.

```python
x = np.linspace(-2, 2, 50)
```

Rerun your program and you should see the following plot appear in the Plots pane.

```{figure} ../_images/6_Line_plot_2.png
:width: 500
```

Here we have used 50 points to plot the graph of $y = x^2$.

## Plot styles

We can change the appearance of a plot by specifying the format after the co-ordinates in the `plt.plot` command.

```python
plt.plot(x, y, format)
```

Where `format` is a string that specifies the colour, marker and line styles.

```python
format = '[colour][line][marker]'
```

The characters for some of the marker, line and colour styles are shown in {numref}`format-specifiers-table` below. Note that these are optional, e.g., if no marker character is specified then the data will be plotted as a line without markers. Also it doesn't matter what order the characters in `format` are, e.g., `'r-o'` produces the same result as `'o-r'`.

```{list-table} Format specifiers for matplotlib line plots
:header-rows: 1
:name: format-specifiers-table

* - Colour
  - Description
  - Line
  - Description
  - Marker
  - Description
* - `b`
  - blue 
  - `-`
  - solid line
  - `.`
  - point marker
* - `g`
  - green
  - `--`
  - dashed line
  - `,`
  - pixel marker
* - `r`
  - red
  - `-.`
  - dash-dot line
  - `o`
  - circle marker
* - `c`
  - cyan
  - `:`
  - dotted line
  - `v`
  - triangle down marker
* - `m`
  - magenta
  - 
  - 
  - `^`
  - triangle up marker
* - `y`
  - yellow 
  - 
  - 
  - `s`
  - square marker
* - `k`
  - black
  - 
  - 
  - `*`
  - star marker 
* - `w`
  - white
  - 
  - 
  - `+`
  - plus marker 
* - 
  -
  -
  -
  - `x` 
  - x marker
```

To demonstrate this lets change our plot so it is plotted using a blue line with a circle marking each point. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
# Format specifiers
plt.plot(x, y, 'b-o')
plt.show()
```

Run your program and you should see the following plot appear in the Plots pane.

```{figure} ../_images/6_Line_plot_3.png
:width: 500
```

## Axis labels and title

Axis labels and titles can be added to a plot using the `plt.xlabel()`, `plt.ylabel()` and `plt.title()` functions.

```python
plt.xlabel('x axis label')
plt.ylabel('y axis label')
plt.title('plot title')
```

Lets add axis labels and a title to our plot. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
# Axis labels and titles
plt.plot(x, y, 'b-o')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.title('y = x^2',)
plt.show()
```

Run your program and you should see the following plot appear in the Plots pane.

```{figure} ../_images/6_Line_plot_4.png
:width: 500
```

### Font properties

We can specify the font properties in axes labels, titles and other plot elements. For example, to set the properties of the $x$-axis label we use

```text
plt.xlabel('label text', fontsize=font size in pt, color='font colour')
```

To demonstrate this, change your code so that it looks like the following.

```python
# Axis labels and titles
plt.plot(x, y, 'b-o')
plt.xlabel('x', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('y', fontsize=14)
plt.title('y = x^2', fontsize=16, color='red')
plt.show()
```

Run your program and you should see the following plot appear in the Plots pane.

```{figure} ../_images/6_Line_plot_5.png
:width: 500
```

### $\LaTeX$

Text in matplotlib plots can also be rendered using $\LaTeX$. Simply surround an equation with dollar signs `$ $`. To demonstrate this edit your code so that it looks like the following.

```python
# Axis labels and titles
plt.plot(x, y, 'b-o')
plt.xlabel('$x$', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('$y$', fontsize=14)
plt.title('$y = x^2$', fontsize=16, color='red')
plt.show()
```

Rerun your program and you should see the following plot appear in the Plots pane.

```{figure} ../_images/6_Line_plot_6.png
:width: 500
```

## Saving a plot to a file

The easiest way to save a plot to a file is to right-click on the plot in the Plots pane and select **Save plot as...**. This will open up a file browser where you can select the folder and filename of the plot. The default file type for a plot is .png (Portable Network Graphics) which is the preferred format for onscreen display and including in electronic documents. 

Sometimes we want to be able to save a plot using a command in our program (e.g., we could have a program for generating multiple plots). To do this we can use the `plt.savefig()` command. 

```python
plt.savefig('filename')
```

To demonstrate this enter the following code into your program

```python
# Save plot to file
plt.savefig('myplot.png')
```

Rerun your program and you should see the file **myplot.png** added to the folder that contains your **6_Plotting.py** file.
