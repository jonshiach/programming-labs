# Methods

A **method** is a function that belongs to a class. A method is declared within the class declaration.

```matlab
class Class_name:
    def method_name(self):
        commands
```

Where `self` is a parameter that refers to the current instance of the class. Lets add a method to our `Member` class, inside the `Method` class declaration, enter the following code.

```matlab
def print(self):
    print("\nUniversity Member Details\n-------------------------")
    print(f"Name     : {self.name}")
    print(f"ID       : {self.ID}")
```

Here we have declared a `print()` method that prints the details of the object. At the end of your program enter the following code.

```matlab
# 7.2 Methods
abby = Member("Abby Anderson", 24135791)

print("\n7.2 Methods\n-----------")
abby.print()
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
7.2 Methods
-----------

University Member Details
-------------------------
Name     : Abby Anderson
ID       : 24135791
```

```{note}
If we try to call the `print()` method on the `ellie`, `joel` or `tommy` objects Python will return an error since when those objects were created our `Member` class did not have a `print()` method. To use this method on these objects we will need to re-create them using the updated class declaration
```

## Exercises

```{exercise}
:label: matlab-oop-exercise-3

Add an attribute called `speed` to your `Vehicle` class from {ref}`matlab-oop-exercise-1` and set it equal to 0. Write a method called `accelerate()` that increases the speed attribute by a given amount ensuring that it doesn't exceed the maximum speed. Use your method to accelerate the two vehicles using the following and print their speed:

1. accelerate the Delorean to 88 mph
2. accelerate the Batmobile to 150 mph
```

```{exercise}
:label: matlab-oop-exercise-4

Add a method to your `Shape` class from {ref}`matlab-oop-exercise-2` that prints the name of the shape and the number of edges it has. Use your method on the `triangle`, `rectangle` and `circle` objects.
```
