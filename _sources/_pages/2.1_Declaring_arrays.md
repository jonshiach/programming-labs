# Declaring arrays

NumPy arrays can be declared using the <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.ndarray.html" target="_blank"> `np.array()`</a> function.

```text
a = np.array([ a1, a2, ..., an ])
```

In Spyder, create a new Python file called **2_Arrays.py** and save it to your OneDrive folder. We are going to declare an array for the vector $\vec{a} = (1, 2, 3)$, enter the code below into your program.

```python
# =============================================================================
# 2. Arrays
# =============================================================================

print("\n2. Arrays\n---------")

import numpy as np

# Declaring arrays
print("\nDeclaring arrays\n---------------")

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(f"a = {a}")
```

Note that the elements in the row vector are contained within square bracket and elements are separated using commas. Run your program and you should see the following.

```text
a = [1 2 3]
```

To declare a 2D array we input multiple row vectors separated by commas.

```python
A = np.array([[ a11, a12, .. , a1n ],
              [ a21, a22, .. , a2n ],
                 :    :         :
              [ am1, am2, .. , amn ]])
```

Lets declare a 2D array for the matrix

$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix}.$$

Enter the following into your program.

```python
A = np.array([ [1, 2,] , [3, 4] ])
print(f"\nA = \n{A}")
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
A = 
[[1 2]
 [3 4]]
```

## Range of numbers

A 1D array containing a sequence of numbers can be generated using the <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html?highlight=numpy%20arange#numpy.arange" target="_blank">`numpy.arange()`</a> command.

```Python
np.arange(start : stop : step)
```

`start` is the first number in the range, `stop` is **1 more than the last number in the range** and `step` is the difference between the numbers. If `start` or `step` aren't specified Python uses default values of `start = 0` and `step = 1`.

To generate an array containing the numbers 1 to 9 we use `start = 1`, `stop = 10` (1 more than the last number 9) and `step = 1`. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
b = np.arange(1, 10, 1)
print(f"\n b = {b}")
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
b = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
```

Since Python uses the default values of `step = 1` we don't need to specify the `step` value. Delete `, 1` and rerun your program, you should see that the output has not changed.

To generate an array containing the even numbers between 0 and 20 inclusive we use `start = 0`, `stop = 21` and `step = 2`.

```python
c = np.arange(0, 21, 2)
print(f"\nc = {c}")
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
c = [ 0  2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18 20]
```

Note that 0 is an even number since the definition of an even number is a number that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2.

We can also use negative step values. To generate an array containing the numbers 10 to 1 in descending order we have `start = 10`, `stop = 0` (1 less than the last number 0) and `step = -1`. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
d = np.arange(10, 0, -1)
print(f"\nd = {d}")
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
d = [10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1]
```

## Generating special matrices

The NumPy library contains functions that can be used to generate arrays for some <a href="https://jonshiach.github.io/LA-book/pages/1.2_Special_matrices.html" target="_blank">special matrices</a> ({numref}`special-matrices-table`).

```{list-table} NumPy functions for generating special matrices
:name: special-matrices-table

* - Function
  - Description
* - `np.zeros((m, n))`
  - An $m \times n$ array of 0s
* - `np.ones((m, n))`
  - An $m \times n$ array of 1s
* - `np.eye(n)`
  - An $n \times n$ identity matrix
```

To print a $1\times 6$ array of 0s add the following code to your program.

```python
# Special arrays
print("\nSpecial arrays\n-----------------------")
print(f"1x6 array of zeros\n\n{np.zeros(6)}")
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Special arrays
-----------------------
1x6 array of zeros

[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
```

To print a $4 \times 4$ array of 1s add the following code to your program.

```python
print(f"\n4x4 array of ones\n\n{np.zeros((4, 4))}")
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
4x4 array of ones

[[0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0.]]
```

To print a $5 \times 5$ identity matrix add the following code to your program.

```python
print(f"\nThe 5x5 identity matrix\n\n{np.eye(5)}")
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
The 5x5 identity matrix

[[1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 1. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 1. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]]
```
