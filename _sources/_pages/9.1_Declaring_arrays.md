# Declaring arrays

NumPy arrays can be declared using the <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.ndarray.html" target="_blank"> `np.array()`</a> function.

```text
a = np.array([ a1, a2, ..., an ])
```

Create a new MATLAB file called **M9_Arrays.py** and save it to your OneDrive folder. We are going to declare an array for the vector $\vec{a} = (1, 2, 3)$, enter the code below into your program.

```matlab
% =========================================================================
% 2. Arrays
% =========================================================================

fprintf("\n9. Arrays\n---------\n")

% 9.1 Declaring arrays
fprintf("9.1 Declaring arrays\n--------------------")
a = [1, 2, 3]
```

Note that the elements in the row vector are contained within square bracket and elements are separated using commas. Run your program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
9. Arrays
---------
9.1 Declaring arrays
--------------------
a =

     1     2     3
```

To declare a 2D array we use semi-colons `;` to separate the rows.

```matlab
A = [ a11, a12, .. , a1n ;
      a21, a22, .. , a2n ;
       :    :         :
      am1, am2, .. , amn ]
```

Lets declare a 2D array for the matrix

$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix}.$$

Enter the following into your program.

```matlab
A = [1, 2 ; 3, 4]
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
A =

     1     2
     3     4
```

## Range of numbers

A 1D array containing a sequence of numbers can be generated using the following MATLAB command
```matlab
array = (start : step : stop)
```

`start` is the first number in the range, `stop` is the last number in the range and `step` is the difference between the numbers. If `step` isn't specified MATLAB uses default values of `step = 1`.

To generate an array containing the numbers 1 to 9 we use `start = 1`, `stop = 9` (1 more than the last number 9) and `step = 1`. Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
b = (1 : 1 : 9)
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
b =

     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9
```

Since MATLAB uses the default value of `step = 1` we don't need to specify the `step` value. Delete `: 1` and rerun your program, you should see that the output has not changed.

To generate an array containing the even numbers between 0 and 20 inclusive we use `start = 0`, `stop = 20` and `step = 2`.

```matlab
c = (0 : 2 : 20)
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
c =

     0     2     4     6     8    10    12    14    16    18    20
```

Note that 0 is an even number since the definition of an even number is a number that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2.

We can also use negative step values. To generate an array containing the numbers 10 to 1 in descending order we have `start = 10`, `stop = 1` (1 less than the last number 0) and `step = -1`. Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
d = (10 : -1 : 1)
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
d =

    10     9     8     7     6     5     4     3     2     1
```

## Generating special matrices

The MATLAB contains functions that can be used to generate arrays for some special matrices.

```{list-table} NumPy functions for generating special matrices
:name: matlab-special-matrices-table

* - Function
  - Description
* - `zeros(m, n)`
  - An $m \times n$ array of 0s
* - `ones(m, n)`
  - An $m \times n$ array of 1s
* - `eye(n)`
  - An $n \times n$ identity matrix
```

To print a $1\times 6$ array of 0s add the following code to your program.

```matlab
% 9.1.2 Special matrices
fprintf("9.1.2 Special matrices\n----------------------")
fprintf("\n1x6 array of zeros")

zeros(1, 6)
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
9.1.2 Special matrices
----------------------
1x6 array of zeros
ans =

     0     0     0     0     0     0
```

To print a $4 \times 4$ array of 1s add the following code to your program.

```matlab
ones(4, 4)
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
ans =

     1     1     1     1
     1     1     1     1
     1     1     1     1
     1     1     1     1
```

To print a $5 \times 5$ identity matrix add the following code to your program.

```matlab
eye(5)
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
ans =

     1     0     0     0     0
     0     1     0     0     0
     0     0     1     0     0
     0     0     0     1     0
     0     0     0     0     1
```
