# Scatter plots

Scatter plots can be produced using the `scatter()` function.

```matlab
scatter(x, y, Linespec)
```

Where `x` and `y` are one-dimensional co-ordinate arrays and `colour` and `Linespec` are characters specifying the colour and marker used for each point (see {numref}`matlab-linespec-table`).

To demonstrate this enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
% Scatter plots
x = rand(1, 100);
y = rand(1, 100);

clf
scatter(x, y, 'r')
xlabel('$x$', FontSize=16, Interpreter='latex')
ylabel('$y$', FontSize=16, Interpreter='latex')
```

The `rand(1, 100)` function generates an array of 100 random numbers in the range $[0, 1]$. Run your program and you should see the following plot added to the plot window (note that yours will look slightly different to this one due to the random numbers generated).

Produce a scatter plot using the arrays `x` and `y` given below. Format your plot so that the points are plotted using blue diamonds and the axes are scaled so that $x,y \in [0, 1]$. 

```text
x = np.array([ 0.1734, 0.3909, 0.8314, 0.8034, 0.0605, 0.3993, 0.5269, 0.4168, 0.6569, 0.6280 ])
y = np.array([ 0.0717, 0.1665, 0.7881, 0.5486, 0.0702, 0.2382, 0.3031, 0.2341, 0.4335, 0.4265 ])
```

We can calculate a line of bets fit for the data from {ref}`matlab-scatter-plots-ex1` using a linear regression model $y = mx + c$ where $m$ is the slope of the line and $c$ is the $y$-intercept. To compute $m$ and $c$ we can rewrite the linear model as $\vec{y} = A\vec{p}$ where $\vec{y} = (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n)^\mathsf{T}$, $\vec{p} = (m, c)^\mathsf{T}$ and

$$ \begin{align*}
    A= 
    \begin{pmatrix} 
        x_1 & 1 \\ x_2 & 1 \\ \vdots & \vdots \\ x_n & 1 
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*} $$

We then solve for $m$ and $c$ using the NumPy command `line = A \ y'` which calculates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares" target="_blank">least squares</a> solution where `line = [m, c]` which minimises the difference between the points $(x_i,y_i)$ and the line $y=mx+c$.

Calculate the line of best fit for the data from {ref}`matlab-scatter-plots-ex1` and add it to your scatter plot.
