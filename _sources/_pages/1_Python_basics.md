# Python Basics

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a multipurpose programming language that is widely used for scientific computation and data analysis. Python is becoming more popular in the workplace as well as academia so it is a good idea to learn it to enhance your skill set.

## Spyder

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a piece of software that provides a way of writing and organising your Python programs as well as a number of useful tools for debugging and organising your code. There are a number of IDEs available for working with Python and the one which we will be using is **Spyder** which is installed on the PCs in the Central Block.

To open Spyder, click on the Windows icon in the bottom left-hand corner, type "Spyder" and click on the Spyder icon. The Spyder window is divided into three panes. The large pane on the left is the editor which is where we can write our Python programs. The pane in the bottom right-hand corner is the console which can be used to enter single line Python commands and is also where Python output is printed by default. The pane in the top right-hand corner contains tools to help us work with Python. For most of our work we will be working with the editor and console panes.
