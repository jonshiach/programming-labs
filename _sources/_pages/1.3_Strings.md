# Strings

A **string** in programming is a sequence of characters and is used to handle text data. A string in Python is declared using single or double quotation marks, so `'hello world'` is the same as `"hello world"`.

Declaring a string variable is simply done by assigning a variable equal to a string.

```text
variable = "string"
```

For example, enter the following into the console.

```python
In [30]: string = "hello world"
```

To output a string we can use the `print()` command (printing is explained in more detail [here](printing-output-section)).

```text
print(variable)
```

Lets print our `string` variable, enter the following into the console

```python
In [31]: print(string)
Out[31]: hello world
```

To define a multiline string we can use triple single or double quotation marks. For example, enter the following into the console[^1],

[^1]: This is a quote from the film *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* by the comedy group Monty Python. The creator of Python, Guido van Rossum, was looking for a short unique name and decided to name Python after Monty Python.

```text
In [31]: multiline_string = """What is the air-speed velocity 
    ...: of an unladen swallow?"""

In [32]: print(multiline_string)
What is the air-speed velocity 
of an unladen swallow?
```

## Modifying strings

Python has the following built-in functions that can be used to modify a string.

```{list-table} String modification functions
:header-rows: 1

* - Function 
  - Description
* - `string.upper()`
  - Converts the characters of a string to uppercase
* - `string.lower()`
  - Converts the characters of a string to lowercase
* - `string.strip()`
  - Remove spaces before and after the characters in a string
* - `string.replace(<old string>, <replacement string>)`
  - Replaces a string with another string
```

To demonstrate these enter the following code into the console.

```python
In [33]: string = "   Hello World   "

In [33]: print(string.upper())
   HELLO WORLD   

In [32]: print(string.lower())
   hello world   

In [33]: print(string.strip())
Hello World

In [34]: print(string.replace("l", "x"))
   Hexxo Worxd   
```

## Concatenating strings

To concatenate (merge) two or more strings we use the `+` operator. 

```text
merged_string = string1 + string2 
```

To demonstrate this enter the following into the console.

```python
In [35]: string1 = "hello"

In [36]: string2 = "world"

In [37]: merged_string = string1 + " " + string2

In [38]: print(merged_string)
hello world
```

Note that we needed to include a space `" "` when concatenating the two words, if we didn't do this the concatenated string would be `helloworld`.

---

## Indexing characters in a string

The characters in a string can be indexed using the character position starting at 0 for the first characeter.

```text
string[ index ]
```

To demonstrate this enter the following into the console.

```python
In [39]: string = "What have the Romans ever done for us?"

In [40]: print(string[0])
W

In [41]: print(string[10])
t
```

Here we have printed the 1st and 11th character in `string`.

To index a range of characters in a string we use a colon to separate the first and last characters in the range.

```text
string[ first_character_index : last_character_index + 1 ]
```

To demonstrate this enter the following into the console.

```python
In [42]: print(string[14:25])
Romans ever
```

Here we have printed the string which consists of the 15th to the 25th character in `string`.

```{note}
A Python string is actually an array of characters so we can use array slicing commands which are covered [later](array-indexing-section) to index strings.
```

---

## Length of a string

The length of a string is the number of characters in the string and can be determined using the `len()` function.

```text
len(string)
```

To demonstrate this enter the following into the console.

```python
In [43]: print(len(string))
38
```

So our string is 38 characters long.

## Exercise

```{exercise}
:label: python-strings-ex

Define two string variables for the following:

- String 1: "Your mother was a hamster"
- String 2: "and your father smelt of elderberries!"

Use your strings to answer the following:

1. Print string 1 using all lowercase characters
2. Print string 2 using all uppercase characters
3. Print string 2 with the word "elderberries" replaced with "roses"
4. Create another string variable by concatenating string 1 and string 2 and print it
5. Print the length of your concatenated string
6. Print the last 30 characters of the concatenated string
```
