Enter the following code into your program (you may want to run your program after entering each line).

```python
# Array operations
B = np.array([ [5, 6], [7, 8] ])

print("\nArray operations\n----------------")
print(f"A = \n{A}")
print(f"\nB = \n{B}")
print(f"\nA + B =\n{A + B}")
print(f"\nA - B =\n{A - B}")
print(f"\n2A = \n{2 * A}")
print(f"\nA^T = \n{A.T}")
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the console output.

```text
Array operations
----------------
A = 
[[1 2]
 [3 4]]

B = 
[[5 6]
 [7 8]]

D = 
[[1 2 5 6]
 [3 4 7 8]]

A + B =
[[ 6  8]
 [10 12]]

A - B =
[[-4 -4]
 [-4 -4]]

2A = 
[[2 4]
 [6 8]]

A^T = 
[[1 3]
 [2 4]]
```

Here we have performed some basic arithmetic operations on the 2D arrays `A` and `B`.

## Element-wise multiplication

When dealing with multiplication of arrays we need to make sure we distinguish between multiplying the elements of two arrays and matrix multiplication. **Element-wise multiplication** of two matrices is defined by

$$ \begin{align*}
    [A \odot B]_{ij} = a_{ij} b_{ij}.
\end{align*} $$

i.e., the corresponding elements are multipied together. Given the matrices

$$ \begin{align*}
    A &= \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix}, &
    B &= \begin{pmatrix} 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 \end{pmatrix},
\end{align*} $$

we have

$$ \begin{align*}
    A \odot B = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1(5) & 2(6) \\
        3(7) & 4(8)
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        5 & 12 \\
        21 & 32
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*} $$

Enter the following code into your program

```python
print(f"\nA * B = \n{A * B}")
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the console output.

```text
A * B = 
[[ 5 12]
 [21 32]]
```

## Matrix multiplication

The other way which we multiply matrice is <a href="https://jonshiach.github.io/LA-book/pages/1.1_Matrix_multiplication.html" target="_blank">matrix multiplication</a> which, for a $m\cdot n$ matrix $A$ and a $p \cdot q$ matrix $B$, is defined by

$$ \begin{align*}
    [AB]_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik}b_{kj}.
\end{align*} $$

So to multiply the matrices $A$ and $B$ defined above we have

$$ \begin{align*}
    AB = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1(5) + 2(7) & 1(6) + 2(8) \\
        3(5) + 4(7) & 3(6) + 4(8)
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        5 + 14 & 6 + 16 \\
        15 + 28 & 18 + 32
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        19 & 22 \\
        43 & 50
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*} $$

To perform matrix multiplication of two NumPy arrays `A` and `B` we use the `np.dot(A, B)` command. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
print(f"\nAB = \n{np.dot(A, B)}")
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the console output.

```text
AB = 
[[19 22]
 [43 50]]
```

To calculate multiple matrix multiplications we could use multiple `np.dot()` commands, i.e., `np.dot(A, np.dot(B, np.dot(C, ...)))`, however it is more convenient to use the `np.lingalg.multi_dot([A, B, C, ...])` command. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
print(f"\nABD = \n{np.linalg.multi_dot([A, B, D])}")
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the console output.

```text
ABD = 
[[ 85 126 249 290]
 [193 286 565 658]]
```

## Element-wise power

**Element-wise** power is defined by

$$ [A ^{\circ k}]_{ij} = a_{ij}^k, $$

so for the matrix $A$ defined above

$$ A^{\circ 2} = \begin{pmatrix} 1^2 & 2^2 \\ 3^2 & 4^2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 4 \\ 9 & 16 \end{pmatrix}.$$

Enter the following code into your program.

```python
print(f"\nA^.2 = \n{A ** 2}")
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the console output.

```text
A^.2 = 
[[ 1  4]
 [ 9 16]]
```

## Matrix power

The matrix power of a square matrix $A$ is denoted by $A^n$ and is defined by

$$ A = \underbrace{A \cdot A \cdots A}_{n \textsf{ times}}. $$

To calculate $A^{\circ k}$ we use the `np.lingalg.matrix_power(A, k)` command. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
print(f"\nA^2 = \n{np.linalg.matrix_power(A, 2)}")
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the console output.

```text
A^2 = 
[[ 7 10]
 [15 22]]
```

## Matrix determinant

The <a href="https://jonshiach.github.io/LA-book/pages/1.3_Determinants.html" target="_blank">determinant</a> of an $n \cdot n$ square matrix is a numerical value calculated using

$$ \begin{align*}
    \det(A) &= \sum_{i = 1}^n (-1)^{i+1} a_{ik} \det(A_i), & k = 1, \ldots n,
\end{align*} $$

where $A_i$ is the matrix formed by removing row $i$ and column $j$ from $A$ and the determinant of a $2 \cdot 2$ matrix $A$ is

$$ \det(A) = a_{11} a_{22} - a_{12} a_{21}. $$

For the matrix $A$ defined above we have

$$ \det(A) = 1(4) - 2(3) = 4 - 6 = -2.$$

The NumPy command to calculate the determinant of the matrix `A` is `np.linalg.det(A)`. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
print(f"\ndet(A) = \n{np.linalg.det(A)}")
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the console output.

```text
det(A) = 
-2.0000000000000004
```

A matrix that has a determinant of 0 is known as a **singular matrix**.

## Matrix inverse

The <a href="https://jonshiach.github.io/LA-book/pages/1.4_Inverse_matrix.html" target="_blank">inverse</a> of a non-singular square matrix $A$, denoted by $A^{-1}$, is a square matrix such that $AA^{-1} = I$ and calculated using

$$ \begin{align*}
    [A^{-1}]_{ij} = \frac{(-1)^{i+j}\det(A_i)}{\det(A)}
\end{align*} $$

For the matrix $A$ defined above

$$ \begin{align*}
    A^{-1} = \frac{1}{-2} \begin{pmatrix} 4 & -2 \\ -3 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -2 & 1 \\ 3/2 & -1/2 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*} $$ 

The NumPy command to calculate the inverse of the matrix `A` is `np.linalg.inv(A)`. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
print(f"\ninv(A) = \n{np.linalg.inv(A)}")
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the console output.

```text
inv(A) = 
[[-2.   1. ]
 [ 1.5 -0.5]]
```
