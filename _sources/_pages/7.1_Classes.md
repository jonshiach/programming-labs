# Classes

A class in Python is declared using the `class` keyword.

```text
class Class_name:
    attributes
```

Where `Class_name` is the name of the class and `attributes` is a list of the class attributes. Once a class has been declared an object of the class is creates using

```text
object_name = Class_name
```

The attributes of an object are accessed using

```text
object_name.attribute
```

Lets create a class for members of the university. Create a new Python file called **7_Object_orientated_programming.py** and save it to your OneDrive folder. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
# =============================================================================
# 7. Classes
# =============================================================================

# 7.1 Classes
class Member:
    name = "Joel Miller"
    ID = 12345678
    

joel = Member

print("\n7.1 Classes\n-----------")
print(joel.name)
print(joel.ID)
```

Here we have declared a class called `Member` which has two attributes `name` and `ID` which we set to a string and an integer. We then create an object called `joel` and print the values of the attributes. Run your program and the you should see the following added to the console.

```text
7.1 Classes
-----------
Joel Miller
12345678
```

## Changing the attributes

Lets create another object of our `Member` class and print out the attributes. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
# 7.1.1 Changing the attributes
ellie = Member

print("\n7.1.1 Changing the attributes\n-----------------------------")
print(ellie.name)
print(ellie.ID)
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
7.1.1 Changing the attributes
-----------------------------
Joel Miller
12345678
```

These details are incorrect for our `ellie` object. To change the values of the attributes we simply access the attributes of the object and set their values. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
ellie.name = "Ellie Williams"
ellie.ID = "24123456"

print()
print(ellie.name)
print(ellie.ID)
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Ellie Williams
24123456
```

## Constructors

Changing the attributes whenever we want to create a new object is a bit cumbersome. Fortunately in python we have the `__init__()` method (a method is a function that belongs to a class) that is called whenever a new object is created. This is known as a **constructor** is an useful for setting the values of attributes and performing any initialisation routines. The Python syntax for a constructor is

```text
def __init__(self, arguments):
    commands to be executed
```

Where `self` is parameter that is the reference to the current instance of the class. Lets declare a constructor to assign the attributes to inputted values and output a message to the console. In your `Member` class, enter the following code.

```python
def __init__(self, name, ID):
    self.name = name
    self.ID = ID
```   

Here we have added a constructor that takes inputs of `name` and `ID` and assigns them to the appropriate attributes. At the end of your program enter the following code.

```python
# 7.1.2 Constructors
tommy = Member("Tommy Miller", 87654321)

print("\n7.1.2 Constructors\n------------------")
print(tommy.name)
print(tommy.ID)
```

We then create a new object `tommy` with its attributes. Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
7.1.2 Constructors
------------------
Tommy Miller
87654321
```

## Exercises

```{exercise}
:label: oop-exercise-1

Create a class called `Vehicle` with a constructor that initialises the attributes `name` and `max_speed`. Create the following objects of the `Vehicle` class and print the values of the attributes.

1. `delorean`: name is `Delorean` and maximum speed is 110
2. `batmobile` name is `Batmobile` and maximum speed is 330
```

```{exercise}
:label: oop-exercise-2

Create a class called `Shape` with a constructor that initialises the attributes `name` and `number_of_edges`. Create objects for the following shapes and print the values of the attributes.

1. a triangle
2. a rectangle
3. a circle
```
