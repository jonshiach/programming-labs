# Strings

A **string** in programming is a sequence of characters and is used to handle text data. A string in MATLAB is declared using single or double quotation marks, so `'hello world'` is the same as `"hello world"`.

Declaring a string variable is simply done by assigning a variable equal to a string.

```text
variable = "string"
```

For example, enter the following into the console.

```matlab
>> string = "hello world"

string = 

    "hello world"
```

## Modifying strings

MATLAB has the following built-in functions that can be used to modify a string.

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Function 
  - Description
* - `upper(string)`
  - Converts the characters of a string to uppercase
* - `lower(string)`
  - Converts the characters of a string to lowercase
* - `strip(string)`
  - Remove spaces before and after the characters in a string
* - `replace(string, old, new)`
  - Replaces the occurrences of `old` with `new` in `string`
```

To demonstrate these enter the following code into the console.

```matlab
>> string = "    Hello world    ";
>> upper(string)

ans = 

    "    HELLO WORLD    "

>> lower(string)

ans = 

    "    hello world    "

>> strip(string)

ans = 

    "Hello world"

>> replace(string, "l", "x")

ans = 

    "    Hexxo worxd    "
```

## Concatenating strings

To concatenate (merge) two or more strings we use the `+` operator. 

```text
merged string = string1 + string2 
```

To demonstrate this enter the following into the console.

```matlab

>> string1 = "hello";
>> string2 = "world";
>> merged_string = string1 + " " + string2

merged_string = 

    "hello world"
```

Note that we needed to include a space `" "` when concatenating the two words, if we didn't do this the concatenated string would be `helloworld`.

## Character arrays

A **character array** is a sequence of characters that can be used to start a short piece of text. They are slightly difference to strings in the a string is a single element whereas a character array is a sequence of elements (similar to strings in Python). To convert a MATLAB string to a character array we can use the `char()` command.

```matlab
character_array = char(string);
```

To demonstrate this enter the following code into the command window.

```matlab
>> string = "What have the Romans ever done for us?"

string = 

    "What have the Romans ever done for us?"

>> character_array = char(string)

character_array =

    'What have the Romans ever done for us?'
```

Note that the character array is contained within single quotes `'string'` whereas a string uses double quotes `"string"`.

### Indexing a character array

The characters in a character array can be indexed using the character position starting at 1 for the first character (note the use of rounded brackets).

```text
character_array(index)
```

To demonstrate this enter the following into the command window.

```matlab
>> character_array(1)

ans =

    'W'

>> character_array(11)

ans =

    't'
```

Here we have printed the 1st and 11th character in `character_array`.

To index a range of characters in a string we use a colon to separate the first and last characters in the range.

```text
character_array[first character index : last character index]
```

To demonstrate this enter the following into the console.

```matlab
>> character_array(15:25)

ans =

    'Romans ever'
```

Here we have printed the string which consists of the 15th to the 25th character in `character_array`.

---

## Length of a string

The length of a string or character array is the number of characters in the string and can be determined using the `length()` function.

```text
length(string)
```

To demonstrate this enter the following into the console.

```matlab
>> length(string)

ans =

    38
```

So our string (and character array) is 38 characters long.

## Exercise

```{exercise}
:label: matlab-strings-ex

Define two string variables for the following:

- String 1: "Your mother was a hamster"
- String 2: "and your father smelt of elderberries!"

Use your strings to answer the following:

1. Print string 1 using all lowercase characters
2. Print string 2 using all uppercase characters
3. Print string 2 with the word "elderberries" replaced with "roses"
4. Create another string variable by concatenating string 1 and string 2 and print it
5. Print the length of your concatenated string (you will need to convert the string to a character array using the `char()` function)
6. Print the last 30 characters of the concatenated string 
```
