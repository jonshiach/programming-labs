# Return values

The majority of functions output (or **return**) an object or a tuple of multiple objects. To return something from a function we use the `return` command.

```text
def function(argument1, argument2, ...)
    commands to be executed
    return output
```

```{important}
The when the `return` command is encountered the function terminates and any indented code following it will not be executed. 
```

To demonstrate this enter the following code into your program.

```python
# 5.3 Return values
def double(x):
    return 2 * x


print("\n5.3 Return values\n-----------------")
print(double(3))
print(double(5))
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
5.3 Return values
-----------------
6
10
```

## Multiple return values

We can return multiple values from a function by listing them after the `return` command.

```text
def function(argument1, argument2, ...)
    commands to be executed
    return output1, output2, ...
```

To demonstrate this lets write a function calculates the area and circumference of a circle. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
# 5.3.1 Multiple return values
def circle(radius):
    pi = 3.141592653589793
    area = pi * radius ** 2
    circumference = 2 * pi * radius

    return area, circumference


area, circ = circle(8)

print("\n5.3.1 Multiple return values\n----------------------------")
print(f"Area          : {area:8.4f}")
print(f"Circumference : {circ:8.4f}")
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
5.3.1 Multiple return values
----------------------------
Area          : 201.0619
Circumference :  50.2655
```

Write a function called `norm()` that calculates the norm (magnitude) of a vector of unknown length. Use your function to calculate the norm of the following vectors:

1. $(1, 2, 3)$
2. $(4, 5, 6, 7)$

```

Euclid's algorithm for computing the *greatest common divisor (GCD)* of two numbers $x$ and $y$ is

1. Find the remainder $r$ of ${x}\div{y}$
2. Set $x = y$ and $y = r$
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until $y = 0$ then the GCD is $x$

For example, lets calculate the GCD of 45 and 210. We have $x = 45$ and $y = 210$ and stepping through the algorithm

- $45/210 = 0$ remainder 45 so $x = 210$ and $y = 45$
- $210/45 = 4$ remainder 30 so $x = 45$ and $y = 30$
- $45/30 = 1$ remainder 15 so $x = 30$ and $y = 15$
- $30/15 = 2$ remainder 0 so $x = 15$ and $y = 0$
- $y = 0$ so the GCD is 15

Write a function called `gcd()` that returns the GCD of two numbers. Use your function to calculate the GCD of:

1. 14 and 245
2. 2414 and 54145
```

The following sequence converges to the square root of a positive number $x$

$$ x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2} \left( x_n + \frac{x}{x_n} \right), $$

where $x_0 = 0$ and $x_1 = 1$. For example, lets use this to calculate $\sqrt{9}$:

$$ \begin{align*}
    x_2 &= \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 + \frac{9}{1} \right) = 5 \\
    x_3 &= \frac{1}{2} \left( 5 + \frac{9}{5} \right) = 3.4 \\
    x_4 &= \frac{1}{2} \left( 3.4 + \frac{9}{3.4} \right) = 3.023529 \\
    x_4 &= \frac{1}{2} \left( 3.023529 + \frac{9}{3.023529} \right) = 3.000091 \\
\end{align*} $$

Define a function called `sqrt()` that calculates numbers in this sequence until the difference two successive numbers is less that $5 \times 10^{-5}$. Use your function to calculate

1. $\sqrt{144}$
2. $\sqrt{12345}$
```
