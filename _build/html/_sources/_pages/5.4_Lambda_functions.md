# Lambda functions

A **lambda function**, also known as an **anonymous function** is a small function consisting of a single expression. A lambda function is declared using

```text
output = lambda arguments : expression
```

To demonstrate this lets declare lambda function to triple a number. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
# 5.4 Lambda functions
triple = lambda x : 3 * x

print("\n5.4 Lambda functions\n--------------------")
print(triple(4))
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
5.4 Lambda functions
--------------------
12
```

## Returning a lambda function

Lambda functions can be used when we want to return a function from another function. For example, lets say that we want a function that multiples the input `x` by some number `k`. Enter the following into your program.

```python
# 5.4.1 Returning a lambda function
def multiply(x):
    return lambda k : k * x
```

We can then use the `multiply()` function to declare other functions to double, triple and quadruple the input. Enter the following into your program.

```python
double = multiply(2)
triple = multiply(3)
quadruple = multiply(4)

print("\n5.4.1 Returning a lambda function\n---------------------------------")
print(double(5))
print(triple(5))
print(quadruple(5)) 
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the console.

## Exercises

```{exercise}
:label: python-lambda-functions-ex1

Write a lambda function that calculates the value $y$ using the following quadratic for different input values of $x$

$$ y = 2x^2 - 3x + 4. $$

Use your function to calculate $y$ when:

1. $x = 2$
2. $x = 3$
```

```{exercise}
:label: python-lambda-functions-ex2

Write a function called `power_function()` that returns a function which raises an input $x$ to the power $n$. Use this function to create the following functions:

1. `square()` that calculates $x^2$
2. `cube()` that calculates $x^3$
3. `quartic()` that calculates $x^4$

Use your functions to calculate the square, cube and quartic of 123.
```
