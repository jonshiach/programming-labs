# For loops

If we want to repeat the execution of a set of commands a given number of times then we can use a **for loop**. The MATLAB syntax for a for loop is

```matlab
for variable = list
    % commands
end
```

The `for` declaration requires a `loop variable` and a `list`. The `loop variable` takes on the value of the first element in `list` and the commands in the indented lines below the for loop declaration are executed for this value. Then the `loop variable` takes on the value of the second element in `list` and the commands in the intended lines below are repeated for this value. The loop continues in this way for all of the elements in `list`.

Create a MATLAB file called **11_Loops.m** and save it to your OneDrive folder. Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
% 11. Loops

clear % Clear all variables
clc   % Clear command window

% For loops
subjects = ["linear algebra", "programming", "calculus"];

for subject = subjects
    fprintf("%s\n", subject)
end
```

Run your program and your should see the following printed to the console.

```text
linear algebra
programming
calculus
```

We can use the command for [generating a range of numbers](matlab-range-section) to loop through sequential values. To demonstrate this enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
fprintf("\n")

for i = 1 : 5
    fprintf("%d\n", i)
end
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
1
2
3
4
5

## The Fibonacci sequence

To demonstrate how useful for loops are we will use one to generate the first $n$ numbers of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence" target="_blank">Fibonacci sequence</a> $F_0, F_1, \ldots, F_n$ which is defined as

$$ F_n &= \begin{cases} 0, & n = 0, \\ 1, & n = 1, \\ F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}, & n \geq 2. \end{cases}$$

Lets write a program to create an array containing the first 20 Fibonacci numbers. Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
% Fibonacci sequence
a = 0;
b = 1;
fprintf("\n%i\n%i", a, b)

for i = 3 : 20
    c = a + b;
    fprintf("%1i\n", c)
    a = b;
    b = c;
end
```

Here we use two variables `a` and `b` to contain two successive Fibonacci numbers which are initialise to 0 and 1 respectively. We then use a for loop to loop through values from 3 to 20 since we already know the first two Fibonacci numbers. Inside the for loop we update calculate the next number in the sequence and print it out and update the values of `a` and `b`.

Run your program and your should see the following added to the console output.

## Exercises

Create a new MATLAB file called **M11_Loops_exercises.m** and save it to your OneDrive folder. Use it to answer the following exercises.

```{exercise}
:label: matlab-loops-ex1

Use a for loop to print "hello world" 10 times.
```

```{exercise}
:label: matlab-loops-ex2

The factorial of a number $n$ is denoted by $n!$ and defined as the product of the numbers 1 to $n$

$$ n! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \cdots (n - 1) \times n. $$

Use a for loop to calculate 52!, the number of ways a regular pack of cards can be shuffled[^1].

[^1]: To give you an idea of how large the number 52! is imagine you are standing on the equator and set a timer to countdown from 52! seconds. After 1 billion years has elapsed take a step forward. Wait another billion years before taking a seconds step. Do this until you’ve reached all the way around the Earth and now take one drop of water out of the Pacific ocean and set it aside. Repeat this whole process until the entire Pacific ocean is drained and then lay a piece of paper on the ground. Repeat this entire process of draining the ocean again to lay another piece of paper on top of the first one. Rinse and repeat until that stack of papers reaches the sun. Complete all of this 1000 more times and you’ll still only be a third of the way through the timer!
```

The series expansion of $\sin(x)$ is

$$\sin(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2 n + 1)!} x^{2n+1}. $$

Use a for loop to compute $\sin(\frac{\pi}{4}) \approx 0.707$ by summing this series up to the first 5 terms. 

Hints: the following commands may come in useful:

- `pi` returns the value of $\pi$
- `factorial(n)` returns $n!$
