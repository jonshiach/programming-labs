# For loops

If we want to repeat the execution of a set of commands a given number of times then we can use a **for loop**. The MATLAB syntax for a for loop is

```matlab
for variable = list
    % commands
end
```

The `for` declaration requires a `loop variable` and a `list`. The `loop variable` takes on the value of the first element in `list` and the commands in the indented lines below the for loop declaration are executed for this value. Then the `loop variable` takes on the value of the second element in `list` and the commands in the intended lines below are repeated for this value. The loop continues in this way for all of the elements in `list`.

Create a MATLAB file called **11_Loops.m** and save it to your OneDrive folder. Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
% =========================================================================
% 4. Loops
% =========================================================================

fprintf("10. Loops\n---------\n")

% For loops
subjects = ["linear algebra", "programming", "calculus"];

fprintf("\n10.1 For loops\n--------------\n")

for subject = subjects
    fprintf("%s\n", subject)
end
```

Run your program and your should see the following printed to the console.

```text
10. Loops
---------

10.1 For loops

```

We can use the command for [generating a range of numbers](matlab-range-section) to loop through sequential values. To demonstrate this enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
fprintf("\n")

for i = 1 : 5
    fprintf("%d\n", i)
end
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
0
1
2
3
4
```

## The Fibonacci sequence

To demonstrate how useful for loops are we will use one to generate the first $n$ numbers of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence" target="_blank">Fibonacci sequence</a> $F_0, F_1, \ldots, F_n$ which is defined as

$$ F_n &= \begin{cases} 0, & n = 0, \\ 1, & n = 1, \\ F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}, & n \geq 2. \end{cases}$$

Lets write a program to create an array containing the first 20 Fibonacci numbers. Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
%% 11.1.1 Fibonacci sequence
F = [0, 1];

for n = 3 : 20
    F = [F, F(n-1) + F(n-2)];
end

fprintf("\n4.1.2 Fibonacci sequence\n------------------\n")
F
```

Here we initialise the array `F` so that it contains the first two values in the sequence and then use a for loop to loop through values of `n = 3, 4, ..., 20`. Inside the for loop we calculate the value of the $n$th number in the sequence and append it to the end of `F`.

Run your program and your should see the following added to the console output.

```text
4.1.2 Fibonacci sequence
------------------

F =

  Columns 1 through 7

           0           1           1           2           3           5           8

  Columns 8 through 14

          13          21          34          55          89         144         233

  Columns 15 through 20

         377         610         987        1597        2584        4181

## Exercises

Create a new MATLAB file called **M11_Loops_exercises.m** and save it to your OneDrive folder. Use it to answer the following exercises.

```{exercise}
:label: matlab-loops-exercise-1

Use a for loop to print "hello world" 10 times.
```

```{exercise}
:label: matlab-loops-exercise-2

The factorial of a number $n$ is denoted by $n!$ and defined as the product of the numbers 1 to $n$

$$ n! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdots (n - 1) \cdot n. $$

Use a for loop to calculate 52!, the number of ways a regular pack of cards can be shuffled. 
```

```{exercise}
:label: matlab-loops-exercise-3

The series expansion of $\sin(x)$ is

$$\sin(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2 n + 1)!} x^{2n+1}. $$

Use a for loop to compute $\sin(\frac{\pi}{4}) \approx 0.707$ by summing this series up to the first 5 terms. 

Hints: the following commands may come in useful:

- `pi` returns the value of $\pi$
- `factorial(n)` returns $n!$
```
