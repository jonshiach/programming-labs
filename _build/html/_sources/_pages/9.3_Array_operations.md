Enter the following code into your program (you may want to run your program after entering each line).

```matlab
% Array operations
A
B = [5, 6 ; 7, 8]

fprintf("A + B")
A + B

fprintf("A - B")
A - B

fprintf("2A")
2 * A

fprintf("A^T")
A'
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the command window.

```text
A =

     1     2
     3     4


B =

     5     6
     7     8

A + B
ans =

     6     8
    10    12

A - B
ans =

    -4    -4
    -4    -4

2A
ans =

     2     4
     6     8

A^T
ans =

     1     3
     2     4
```

Here we have performed some basic arithmetic operations on the 2D arrays `A` and `B`.

## Element-wise multiplication

When dealing with multiplication of arrays we need to make sure we distinguish between multiplying the elements of two arrays and matrix multiplication. **Element-wise multiplication** of two matrices is defined by

$$ \begin{align*}
    [A \odot B]_{ij} = a_{ij} b_{ij}.
\end{align*} $$

i.e., the corresponding elements are multipied together. Given the matrices

$$ \begin{align*}
    A &= \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix}, &
    B &= \begin{pmatrix} 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 \end{pmatrix},
\end{align*} $$

we have

$$ \begin{align*}
    A \odot B = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1(5) & 2(6) \\
        3(7) & 4(8)
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        5 & 12 \\
        21 & 32
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*} $$

Enter the following code into your program

```matlab
fprintf("A .* B")
A .* B
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the command window.

```text
A .* B
ans =

     5    12
    21    32
```

## Matrix multiplication

The other way which we multiply matrice is <a href="https://jonshiach.github.io/LA-book/_pages/1.1_Matrix_multiplication.html" target="_blank">matrix multiplication</a> which, for a $m\times n$ matrix $A$ and a $p \times q$ matrix $B$, is defined by

$$ \begin{align*}
    [AB]_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik}b_{kj}.
\end{align*} $$

So to multiply the matrices $A$ and $B$ defined above we have

$$ \begin{align*}
    AB = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1(5) + 2(7) & 1(6) + 2(8) \\
        3(5) + 4(7) & 3(6) + 4(8)
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        5 + 14 & 6 + 16 \\
        15 + 28 & 18 + 32
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        19 & 22 \\
        43 & 50
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*} $$

To perform matrix multiplication of two NumPy arrays `A` and `B` we use the `A * B` command. Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
fprintf("A * B")
A * B
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the command window.

```text
A * B
ans =

    19    22
    43    50
```

To calculate multiple matrix multiplications we simply chain multiple multiplication commands. Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
fprintf("ABA")
A * B * A
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the command window.

```text
ABA
ans =

    85   126
   193   286
```

## Element-wise power

**Element-wise** power is defined by

$$ [A ^{\circ k}]_{ij} = a_{ij}^k, $$

so for the matrix $A$ defined above

$$ A^{\circ 2} = \begin{pmatrix} 1^2 & 2^2 \\ 3^2 & 4^2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 4 \\ 9 & 16 \end{pmatrix}.$$

Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
fprintf("A .^ 2")
A .^ 2
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the command window.

```text
A .^ 2
ans =

     1     4
     9    16
```

## Matrix power

The matrix power of a square matrix $A$ is denoted by $A^n$ and is defined by

$$ A = \underbrace{A \cdot A \cdots A}_{n \textsf{ times}}. $$

To calculate $A^k$ we use the `A ^ k` command. Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
fprintf("A ^ 2")
A ^ 2
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the command window.

```text
A ^ 2
ans =

     7    10
    15    22
```

## Matrix determinant

The <a href="https://jonshiach.github.io/LA-book/_pages/1.3_Determinants.html" target="_blank">determinant</a> of an $n \times n$ square matrix is a numerical value associated with the matrix. The MATLAB command to calculate the determinant of the matrix `A` is `det(A)`. Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
fprintf("det(A) = %0.2f \n", det(A))
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the command window.

```text
det(A) = -2.00
```

A matrix that has a determinant of 0 is known as a **singular matrix**.

---

## Matrix inverse

The <a href="https://jonshiach.github.io/LA-book/_pages/1.4_Inverse_matrix.html" target="_blank">inverse</a> of a non-singular (a matrix with a non-zero determinant) square matrix $A$, denoted by $A^{-1}$, is a square matrix such that $AA^{-1} = I$. The MATLAB command to calculate the inverse of the matrix `A` is `inv(A)`. Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
fprintf("\ninv(A)")
inv(A)
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the command window.

```text
inv(A)
ans =

   -2.0000    1.0000
    1.5000   -0.5000
```

To check whether this is the inverse of $A$ we can calculate $A \cdot A^{-1}$ which should return the identity matrix. Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
fprintf("\nA * inv(A)")
A * inv(A)
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console output.

```text
A * inv(A)
ans =

    1.0000         0
    0.0000    1.0000
```
