# Printing output

We can use the `fprintf()` function to print a string to the command window.

```matlab
fprintf(string)
```

Lets print a short header that tells someone what our program does. Edit your program so that the following appears at the top of the file

```matlab
fprintf("\nDegrees to radians conversion\n-----------------------------")
```

Running your program you should see the following printed to the console.

```text
Degrees to radians conversion
-----------------------------
0.785398175
```

Note that the `\n` character created a newline in the output.

## Printing text and numbers

To print text and numbers in the same string we use

```matlab
fprintf("some text %x.x", variable)
```

where `formatspec` is a **formatting operator** that controls how the `variable` is printed. To demonstrate this edit your program so that it looks like the following.

```matlab
fprintf("\nDegrees to radians conversion\n-----------------------------")

angle_in_degrees = 45;
angle_in_radians = angle_in_degrees * pi / 180;

fprintf("\nangle in degrees = %6.3f\n", angle_in_degrees)
fprintf("angle in radians = %6.3f\n", angle_in_radians)
```

Running your program you should see the following printed to the console.

```text
Degrees to radians conversion
-----------------------------
angle in degrees = 45.000
angle in radians =  0.785
```

Notice that the angles have been printed using 3 decimal places. This is because we have used the formatting operator `%6.3f` which tells MATLAB to print a float value that uses a total of 6 character spaces (including the decimal point) with 3 significant figures following the decimal point.

The different types of formatting operators are shown in {numref}`matlab-formatting-operators-table`.

```{list-table} Format specifiers
:header-rows: 1
:name: matlab-formatting-operators-table

* - Data type
  - MATLAB code
  - Output
* - integer
  - `fprintf("%3d \n", 2)`
  - `##2` (two blank spaces followed by `2`)
* - float
  - `fprintf("%10.3f \n", 1/3)`
  - `#####0.333`
* - Scientific notation
  - `fprintf("%10.2e \n", 123456)`
  - `##1.23e+05` (equivalent to $1.23\times 10^{5}$)
* - String
  - `fprintf("%10s world \n", "hello")`
  - `#####hello world`
```

If the number to the left of the decimal point is zero, MATLAB will use the smallest number of spaces required to print the number, e.g., `fprintf("%0.2f \n", 1.23456)` will print `1.23`.

## The newline character

The newline character, `\n`, is used to instruct MATLAB to print the rest of the string on new line. For example

```matlab
fprintf("This text \nis printed\n\non multiple lines \n\n\nusing a single print command.\n")
```

will print

```text
This text 
is printed

on multiple lines 


using a single print command.
```

## Exercise

````{exercise}
:label: matlab-basics-exercise-5

Write a program that determines the number of years, weeks, days, minutes and seconds that are in a given number of seconds. Your program should print out the result as a single sentence that mixes text and numbers. For example, if the given number of seconds is 1 million, then your program should print

```text
There are 0 years, 1 weeks, 4 days, 13 hours, 46 minutes and 40 seconds in 1000000 seconds.
```

Use your program to print the number of years, weeks, days, hours and minutes in 1 billion seconds.
