# Logical operators

There are three main **logical operators** (also known as logical connectors) available in Python. These are used to combine conditional statements to form a logical argument.

- logical OR is denoted by $x \lor y$ and returns a true result if either $x$ **or** $y$ is true
- logical AND is denoted by $x \land y$ and returns a true result only if both $x$ **and** $y$ is true
- logical NOT is denoted by $\lnot x$ and returns the opposite values to $x$. 

We can illustrate all of the possible combinations of $x$ and $y$ and the logical operations given above in a **truth table** as shown below.

| $x$ | $y$ | $x \lor y$ | $x \land y$ | $\lnot x$ | $\lnot y$ |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

## Python logical operators

Logical conditions can be connected using logical operators given in {numref}`logical-operators-table`.

```{list-table} Logical operators
:name: logical-operators-table
:header-rows: 1

* - Operator
  - Description
  - Python syntax
* - $x \lor y$ 
  - logical or
  - `x or y`
* - $x \land y$
  - logical and
  - `x and y`
* - $\lnot x$
  - logical not
  - `not x`
```

Lets produce a truth table for the these logical operators. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
# Logical operators
print("\n x | y | x or y | x and y | not x | not y")
print("-----------------------------------------")

x, y = 0, 0
print(f" {x} | {y} |   {x or y}    |    {x and y}    |   {not x:d}   |   {not y:d}")

x, y = 0, 1
print(f" {x} | {y} |   {x or y}    |    {x and y}    |   {not x:d}   |   {not y:d}")

x, y = 1, 0
print(f" {x} | {y} |   {x or y}    |    {x and y}    |   {not x:d}   |   {not y:d}")

x, y = 1, 1
print(f" {x} | {y} |   {x or y}    |    {x and y}    |   {not x:d}   |   {not y:d}")
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the console output.

```text
 x | y | x or y | x and y | not x | not y
-----------------------------------------
 0 | 0 |   0    |    0    |   1   |   1
 0 | 1 |   1    |    0    |   1   |   0
 1 | 0 |   1    |    0    |   0   |   1
 1 | 1 |   1    |    1    |   0   |   0
```
