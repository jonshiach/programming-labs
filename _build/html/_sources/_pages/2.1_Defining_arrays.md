# Defining arrays

To define a 1D array in Python we can use the NumPy command <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.ndarray.html" target="_blank"> `np.array`</a>.

```Python
A = np.array([a1, a2, ... , an ])
```

In Spyder create a new Python file called **2_Arrays.py** and save it to your OneDrive folder. We are going to create an array for the vector $\vec{a} = (1, 2, 3)$, enter the code below into your program.

```python
import numpy as np

# Defining arrays
print("Defining arrays\n---------------")
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(f"a = {a}")
```
Note that the elements in the row vector are contained within square bracket and elements are separated using commas. Run your program and you should see the following.

```text
a = [1 2 3]
```

To define a 2D array (i.e., a matrix) we input multiple row vectors separated by commas.

```python
A = np.array([[ a11, a12, .. , a1n ],
              [ a21, a22, .. , a2n ],
                 :    :         :
              [ am1, am2, .. , amn ]])
```

Lets define a 2D array for the matrix

$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix}.$$

Enter the following into your program.

```python
A = np.array([ [1, 2,] , [3, 4] ])
print(f"\nA = \n{A}")
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console output.

```text
A = 
[[1 2]
 [3 4]]
```

## Range of numbers

A one-dimensional array containing a sequence of numbers can be generated using the `np.arange()` command (<a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html?highlight=numpy%20arange#numpy.arange" target="_blank">`numpy.arange` help page</a>). 

```Python
np.arange(<start> : <stop> : <step>)
```

`<start>` is the first number in the range, `<stop>` is **1 more than the last number in the range** and `<step>` is the difference between the numbers. If `<start>` or `<step>` aren't specified Python uses default values of `start = 0` and `step = 1`.

To generate an array containing the numbers 1 to 9 we use `start = 1`, `stop = 10` (1 more than the last number 9) and `step = 1`. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
b = np.arange(1, 10, 1)
print(f"\n b = {b}")
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console output.

```text
b = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
```

Since Python uses the default values of `step = 1` we don't need to specify the `step` value. Delete `, 1` and rerun your program, you should see that the output has not changed.

To generate an array containing the even numbers between 0 and 20 inclusive we use `start = 0`, `stop = 21` and `step = 2`.

```python
c = np.arange(0, 21, 2)
print(f"\nc = {c}")
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console output.

```text
c = [ 0  2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18 20]
```

Note that 0 is an even number since the definition of an even number is a number that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2.

We can also use negative step values. To generate an array containing the numbers 10 to 1 in descending order we have `start = 10`, `stop = 0` (1 less than the last number 0) and `step = -1`. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
d = np.arange(10, 0, -1)
print(f"\nd = {d}")
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console output.

```text
d = [10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1]
```

## Generating special matrices

The NumPy library has some commands that can be used to generate <a href="https://jonshiach.github.io/LA-book/pages/1.2_Special_matrices.html" target="_blank">special matrices</a>. To generate an array containing all zeros, all ones or the identity matrix we can use the following commands

```text
np.zeros( (<number of rows>, <number of columns>) )
np.ones( (<number of rows>, <number of columns>) )
np.eye(<number of rows and columns>)
```

To print a $4\times 4$ array of zeros add the following code to your program.

```python
# Special arrays
print("\nDefining special arrays\n-----------------------")
print(f"1x6 array of zeros\n\n{np.zeros(6)}")
print(f"\n4x4 array of ones\n\n{np.zeros( (4, 4) )}")
print(f"\nThe 5x5 identity matrix\n\n{np.eye(5)}")
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console output.

```text
Defining special arrays
-----------------------
1x6 array of zeros

[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

4x4 array of ones

[[0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0.]]

The 5x5 identity matrix

[[1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 1. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 1. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]]
```

## Concatenating arrays

NumPy arrays can be **concatenated** (merged) using the `np.concatenate` command (<a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.concatenate.html?highlight=concatenate#numpy.concatenate" target="_blank">`np.concatenate` help page</a>).

```text
np.concatenate( (<array 1>, <array 2>), axis=<axis>)
```

If you want to place `array 2` under `array 1` then `axis = 0`, else if you want `array 2` to be placed to the right of `array 1` then `axis = 1`.  Enter the following code into your program.

```python
# Concenating arrays
print("\nConcatenating arrays\n--------------------")

B = np.array([ [5, 6], [7, 8] ])
print(f"A = \n{A}")
print(f"\nB = \n{B}")

C = np.concatenate((A, B), axis=0)
print(f"\nC = \n{C}")

D = np.concatenate((A, B), axis=1)
print(f"\nD = \n{D}")
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console output.

```text
Concatenating arrays
--------------------
A = 
[[1 2]
 [3 4]]

B = 
[[5 6]
 [7 8]]

C = 
[[1 2]
 [3 4]
 [5 6]
 [7 8]]

D = 
[[1 2 5 6]
 [3 4 7 8]]
```

```{exercise}
:label: defining-arrays-exercise

Create a new Python file called `1_Arrays_exercises.py` and write a program to answer the following.

1. Define and print arrays corresponding to the following vectors and matrices

$$\begin{align*}
   \vec{a} &= (6, 3, 4, -1) &
   B &= \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 5 & -2 \\ 2 & 4 & 3 \\ 7 & 2 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \\
   C &= \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & -1 & 4 \\ 7 & -3 & 9 & -5 \end{pmatrix} &
   D &= \begin{pmatrix} -4 & 4 & 2 \\ 7 & 5 & -3 \\ 5 & 1 & 6 \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*} $$

2. Use NumPy commands to print the following arrays

- An array of odd numbers up to and including 31
- An array containing the multiples of 6 that between 0 and 100 inclusive 
- An array containing the multiples of 9 between 900 and 1000 in reverse order
- A $4\times 8$ array of 3s
- A $10 \times 10$ identity matrix

3. Use the `np.concatenate()` command to print the following:

- The $D$ appended to the right of $B$
- The first two rows of $D$ appended to the bottom of $B$

```
