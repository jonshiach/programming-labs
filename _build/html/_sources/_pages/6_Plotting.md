# Plotting

We can use Python to produce plots of data and save them to a file. Here we will look at how we can create the most common types of plots.

## matplotlib

<a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank">matplotlib</a> is a library of functions that allows us to produce plots of data within a Python program. Like with other libraries, we need to import it using the `import` command. For example, to import the `matplotlib` module `pyplot` which is used for the most common plots we use the following code

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

This will allow us to call `pyplot` functions using the precursor `plt.`.
