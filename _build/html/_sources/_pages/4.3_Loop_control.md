# Loop control

Sometimes it may be necessary to interrupt the normal flow of a loop to either terminate the the loop before the loop has been completed or to move to the next iteration straight away. To do this Python uses the `break` and `continue` commands.

## Break

The `break` command is used to exit a loop straight away without executing any more commands within the loop.

To demonstrate the use of the `break` command we are going to calculate the golden ratio using Fibonacci numbers. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio" target="_blank">golden ratio</a> is the ratio between two numbers, $a$ and $b$, where $a+b$ is to $b$ as $b$ is to $a$ and is denoted by $\varphi$. The actual value of $\varphi$ is

$$ \varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = 1.618\ldots$$

A property of the Fibonacci sequence is that the ratio between two successive numbers in the sequence, $F_{n} / F_{n-1}$, converges to $\varphi$ as $n$ gets large (note that this does not work for the first two numbers since $F_0 = 0$ and we cannot divide by zero), for example

$$ \begin{align*}
    \frac{F_2}{F_1} &= \frac{1}{1} = 1, &
    \frac{F_3}{F_2} &= \frac{2}{1} = 2, &
    \frac{F_4}{F_3} &= \frac{3}{2} = 1.5, &
    \frac{F_5}{F_4} &= \frac{5}{3} = 1.\dot{6}, &
    &\ldots
\end{align*} $$

To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

```python
# 4.3.1 The break command
for n in range(2, len(F)):
    phiEstimate1 = F[n] / F[n-1]
    phiEstimate2 = F[n+1] / F[n]
    
    if abs(phiEstimate1 - phiEstimate2) < 1e-6:
        break
  
print("\n4.3.1 The break command\n-----------------------")  
print(f"The estimated value of phi is {phiEstimate2:0.8f}.")   
print(f"The actual value of phi is {(1 + np.sqrt(5))/2:0.8f} (correct to 8 decimal places).")
```

Here we use a for loop to loop through values of `n` from 3 to the number of elements in `F` and calculate two estimates of $\varphi$ using successive pairs of Fibonacci numbers. We then use an if statement to check whether the absolute difference between the two estimates of is less than `1e-6` which is equal to 0.000001. If this is the case we use the `break` command to exit the for loop and print the result to the console.

Run your program and you will see the following added to the console output.

```text
4.3.1 The break command
-----------------------
The estimated value of phi is 1.61803381.
The actual value of phi is 1.61803399 (correct to 8 decimal places).
```

Note that we could have used a while loop here to do the same thing without needing to use a `break` command.

## Continue

The `continue` command moves onto the next cycle of a loop straight away without executing any following commands in the loop. For example, lets say we want to add up all of the even Fibonacci numbers less than 1 million. To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

```python
# 4.3.2 Continue command
sum_ = 0
for n in F:
    if n % 2 == 1:
        continue

    sum_ += n
        
print("\n4.3.2 The continue command\n--------------------------")
print(f"The sum of the even Fibonacci numbers less than 1 million is {sum_}.")
```

Here we initialise a `sum_` variable to 0 (we use `sum_` to avoid overwriting the built-in `sum` function) and then loop through all of the elements of `F`. The current element of `F`is checked to see if it is an odd number (remember that `n % 2` returns the remainder of `n / 2`) and if so we continue to the next iteration. Following the if statement we add the current element of `F` to `sum_`.

Run your program and you will see the following added to the console output.

```text
4.3.2 The continue command
--------------------------
The sum of the even Fibonacci numbers less than 1 million is 1089154.
```

## Exercises

```{exercise}
:label: python-loop-control-ex1

Write a program that uses a for loop to determine whether an integer is prime or not. Use your program to determine of the following are prime:

1. 1009
2. 2123
3. 6269
4. 8441
```

```{exercise}
:label: python-loop-control-ex2

Use a while loop to create a guessing game where the user has to guess the value of a random integer between 0 and 100. For each guess the game will tell the user whether their guess is greater or less than the random integer. The user wins the game if they guess correctly within 5 guesses. 

Hints:

- the command `int(input("text"))` can be used to prompt the user to enter an integer
- the NumPy command `np.random.randint(a, b)` generates a random integer in the range `a` to `b`
```
