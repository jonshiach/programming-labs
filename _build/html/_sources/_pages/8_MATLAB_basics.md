# MATLAB Basics

<a href="https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html" target="_blank">MATLAB</a> is a programming language designed for numerical computation and is widely used by mathematicians and engineers. Whilst Python will be the primary language that you will use during your course, some units that concentrate on numerical methods will make use of MATLAB.
