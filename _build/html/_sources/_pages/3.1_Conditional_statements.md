# Conditional statements

Conditional statements are statements which we can use to make decisions based on its result. They return a Boolean value of either `True` or `False` depending on what condition we have applied.

```{list-table} Conditional statements
:name: conditional-statements-table
:header-rows: 1

* - Operator
  - Description
  - Python syntax
* - $=$
  - equal
  - `x == y`
* - $\neq$
  - not equal to
  - `x != y`
* - $>$
  - greater than
  - `x > y`
* - $<$
  - less than
  - `x < y`
* - $\geq$
  - greater than or equal to
  - `x >= y`
* - $\leq$
  - less than or equal to
  - `x <= y`
```

Python can also assume a numerical value of a boolean value where 1 is the same as `True` and 0 is the same as `False`. Create a new Python file called **3_If_statements.py** and save it to your OneDrive folder. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
# 3. If statements

# Conditional statements
print(f"1 == 2 : {1 == 2}")
print(f"1 != 2 : {1 != 2}")
print(f"1 > 2  : {1 > 2}")
print(f"1 < 2  : {1 < 2}")
print(f"1 >= 2 : {1 >= 2}")
print(f"1 <= 2 : {1 <= 2}")
```

Run your program and your should see the following printed to the console.

```text
1 == 2: False
1 != 2: True
1 > 2 : False
1 < 2 : True
1 >= 2: False
1 <= 2: True
```
