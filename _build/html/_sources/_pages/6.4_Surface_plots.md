# Surface plots

To create a 3D plot we first need to create a 3D axis using the `Axes3D` toolkit which is done using the following commands.

```python
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes(projection='3d')
```

Surface plots can then be generated using the `ax.plot_surface()` function

```python
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z)
```

where `X`, `Y` and `Z` are 2D co-ordinate arrays. To produce a surface plot of the bi-variate function $z=f(x,y)$ we require $x$ and $y$ co-ordinates in the domain. The `np.meshgrid()` function is useful for generating these.

```python
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
```

This generates two 2D arrays `X` and `Y` from two 1D arrays `x` and `y`. `X` contains the elements of `x` arranged in rows and `Y` contains the elements of `y` arranged in columns. To demonstrate this enter the following code into your program.

```python
# Mesh grid
x = np.linspace(0, 4, 5)
y = np.linspace(0, 3, 4)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

print()
print(f"x = {x}")
print(f"y = {y}")
print(f"\nX = \n{X}")
print(f"\nY = \n{Y}")
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
6.5 Mesh grid
-------------
x = [0. 1. 2. 3. 4.]
y = [0. 1. 2. 3.]

X = 
[[0. 1. 2. 3. 4.]
 [0. 1. 2. 3. 4.]
 [0. 1. 2. 3. 4.]
 [0. 1. 2. 3. 4.]]

Y = 
[[0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [1. 1. 1. 1. 1.]
 [2. 2. 2. 2. 2.]
 [3. 3. 3. 3. 3.]]
```

Lets produce a surface plot of the bi-variate function $f(x, y) = \sin(\pi x) + \cos(\pi y)$ for $x, y \in [-1, 1]$. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
# Plot surface
x = np.linspace(-1, 1, 30)
y = np.linspace(-1, 1, 30)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
Z = np.sin(np.pi * X) * np.sin(np.pi * Y)

from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes(projection='3d')
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z)
plt.xlabel('$x$')
plt.ylabel('$y$')
plt.title('$f(x,y) = \sin(\pi x)\sin(\pi y)$')
plt.show()
```

Run your program and you should see the following plot added to the Plots pane.

## Colormaps

The plot of the surface shown above uses the default maplotlib colour of blue which is pretty uninspiring. We can add colours to a surface plot in the form of a **colormap** where the color used for the surface is based on some value, e.g., the height. A colormap can be added to a surface plot using the `cmap` property

```python
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, cmap='colormap')
```

where `colormap` is the name of the colormap to be applied (see <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/colors/colormaps.html" target="_blank">matplotlib documentation</a> for a list of these). Lets demonstrate this by applying the `jet` colormap to our surface plot,change your code so that the plotting command looks like the following.

```python
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, cmap='jet')
```

Run your program and you should see the following plot added to the Plots pane.

```{figure} ../_images/6_Surface_plot_2.png
:width: 600
:alt: Surface plot with colourmap applied
```

## Line colour

The default line colour for matplotlib surface plots is white which can make the detail of a surface difficult to see. The line colour can be changed using the `edgecolor` property

```python
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, edgecolor='colour')
```

Note that `edgecolor` can be abbreviated to `ec`. Let change the line colour of our surface plot to black, change your code so that the plotting command looks like the following.

```python
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, cmap='jet', edgecolor='k')
```

Run your program and you should see the following plot added to the Plots pane.

```{figure} ../_images/6_Surface_plot_3.png
:width: 600
:alt: Surface plot with line colours changed
```

## View angle

With 3D plots we can control the position of the viewpoint using the `view_init()` function

```python
ax.view_init(elev=elevation, azim=azimuth)
```

where `elevation` and `azimuth` are the angles (in degrees) that specify the vertical and horizontal position of the viewpoint relative to the centre of view.

```{figure} https://matplotlib.org/stable/_images/mplot3d_view_angles.png
:width: 300
:alt: Diagram showing elevation and azimuth angles

Azimuth and elevation angles (from <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/toolkits/mplot3d/view_angles.html" target="_blank">matplotlib.org</a>)
```

Lets view our surface plot from an azimuth angle of 30$^\circ$ and an elevation of 20$^\circ$. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
# View angle
ax.view_init(elev=20, azim=30)
```

Run your program and you should see the following plot added to the Plots pane.

```{figure} ../_images/6_Surface_plot_4.png
:width: 600

## Exercise

```{exercise}
:label: python-surface-plot-ex

Produce a surface plot of the function $f(X, y) = \exp(-20((x - 0.5)^2 + (y - 0.5)^2))$ over the domain $x,y \in [0, 1]$ using the `autumn` colormap. 
```
