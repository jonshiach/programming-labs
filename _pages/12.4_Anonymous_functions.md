# Anonymous functions

An **anonymous function** is a small function consisting of a single expression. An anonymous function is declared using

```python
function_name = @(argument) expression;
```

Anonymous functions can be declared anywhere in a MATLAB script file. To demonstrate this lets declare an anonymous function to triple a number. Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
% Anonymous functions
triple = @(x) 3 * x;

triple(4)
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
ans =

    12
```

## Returning an anonymous function

Anonymous functions can be used when we want to return a function from another function. For example, lets say that we want a function that multiples the input `x` by some number `k`. Enter the following into the end of your program

```matlab
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
function anonymous_function = multiply(x)

anonymous_function = @(k) k * x;

end
```

and make a call to this function by entering the following code before the function declarations.

```python
% Returning an anonymous function
my_double = multiply(2);
triple = multiply(3);
quadruple = multiply(4);

fprintf("%d\n", my_double(5))
fprintf("%d\n", triple(5))
fprintf("%d\n", quadruple(5))
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the command window.

```text
10
15
20
```

## Exercises

```{exercise}
:label: matlab-anonymous-functions-ex1

Write an anonymous function that calculates the value $y$ using the following quadratic for different input values of $x$

$$ y = 2x^2 - 3x + 4. $$

Use your function to calculate $y$ when:

1. $x = 2$
2. $x = 3$
```

```{exercise}
:label: matlab-anonymous-functions-ex2

Write a function called `power_function()` that returns a function which raises an input $x$ to the power $n$. Use this function to create the following functions:

1. `square()` that calculates $x^2$
2. `cube()` that calculates $x^3$
3. `quartic()` that calculates $x^4$

Use your functions to calculate the square, cube and quartic of 123.
```
