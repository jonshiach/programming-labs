# Arguments

We can pass information to a function in the form of **arguments**. When a function is declared, the input arguments are listed inside the brackets and separated by commas.

```text
def function(argument):
    commands to be executed
```

To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

```python
# Arguments
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello {name}")
    

print()
greet("Joel")
```

Here we have declared a function called `greet()` that has a single input argument `name`. We then call this function specifying the input string `"Joel"`. Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Hello Joel
```

Lets say that Ellie has entered the chat and we would like to greet them. To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

```python
greet("Ellie")
```

Rerun your program and you should see the following added to the console output.

```text
Hello Ellie
```

## Multiple arguments

A Python function can have any number of arguments which are listed in the brackets separated by commas.

```text
def function(argument1, argument2, ...):
    commands to be executed
```

To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

```python
# Multiple arguments
def print_name_and_age(first_name, last_name, age):
    print(f"Name: {first_name} {last_name}")
    print(f"Age : {age}")
    

print()
print_name_and_age("Joel", "Miller", 56)
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
5.2.1 Multiple arguments
------------------------
Name: Joel Miller
Age : 56
```

---

## Arbitrary arguments *args

If you don't know how many arguments will be passed into your function we can use **arbitrary arguments** by adding an `*` before the argument name. This means that the arbitrary argument will be a *tuple* (an ordered set of objects).

```text
def function(*args)
    commands to be executed
```

```{note}
The argument name `*args` is not a requirement and we could use any argument name, e.g., `*names`. However, it is common to use `*args` as it reminds someone reading the code that the arbitrary argument is a tuple.
```

To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

```python
# Arbitrary arguments
def print_names(*args):
    for name in args:
        print(f"{name}")
        

print()
print_name("Ellie", "Joel")
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Ellie
Joel
```

So the `print_names()` function has an arbitrary argument `names` and by passing two strings into the function both of the strings are printed. Now enter the following code into your program.

```python
print()
print_name("Tommy", "Dina", "Jesse")
```

Rerun your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Tommy
Dina
Jesse
```

So we can pass any number of strings into the `print_names()` function.

## Arbitrary keyword arguments **kwargs

**Keyword arguments** are similar to arbitrary arguments with the exception that we can apply a *keyword* or name to each of the arguments.

```text
def function(**kwargs)
    commands to be executed
```

```{note}
Similar to `*args`, the argument name `**kwargs` is not a requirement and it could be any name after the `**`. Again, it is common to use `**kwargs` to remind someone reading the code that it is an arbitrary keyword argument. 
```

To access the keyword arguments we can use `kwargs[<argument>]`. To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

```python
# Arbitrary keyword arguments
def print_name_and_age(**kwargs):
    print(f"Name: {kwargs['first_name']} {kwargs['last_name']}")
    print(f"Age : {kwargs['age']}")


print()   
print_name_and_age(age = 23, last_name = "Anderson", first_name = "Abby")
```

Here we are passing the three keyword arguments, `age`, `last_name` and `first_name` into the function. Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Name: Abby Anderson
Age : 23
```

When using arbitrary keyword arguments the order in which the arguments are passed to the function does not matter. To demonstrate this, enter the following code to your program.

```python
print_name_and_age(first_name = "Tommy", age = 53, last_name = "Miller")
```

Rerun your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Name: Tommy Miller
Age : 53
```

## Ordering arguments

When we combine standard arguments, arbitrary arguments and arbitrary keyword arguments we must add them to the function declaration is the following order

```text
def function(argument1, argument2, *args, **kwargs)
```

## Exercises

````{exercise}
:label: python-function-arguments-ex1

Write a function called `odd_or_even()` that outputs a message to the console stating whether an inputted number is odd or even. Use your function on the following:

1. 2
2. 5
3. 0
````

```{exercise}
:label: python-function-arguments-ex2

Write a function called `isprime()` that checks whether an inputted integer is a prime and prints the result. Use your function to determine which of the following are prime:

1. 3469
2. 6137
```

```{exercise}
:label: python-function-arguments-ex3

Write a function called `mean()` that takes in the inputs of an unknown number of values and prints the mean value. Use your function to output the mean of the following numbers correct to 4 decimal places:

1. 1, 2, 3, 4
2. 5, 3, 7, 5, 8, 2, 4, 2, 1
```
