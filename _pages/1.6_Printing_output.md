# Printing output

In previous sections have used the `print()` function to print the value of a variable to the console. This can be used to print a variety of data types, for example the command

```python
print("hello world")
```

will print the text string `hello world`. Lets print a short header that tells someone what our program does. Edit your program so that the following appears above the `pi` variable declaration

```python
print("Degrees to radians conversion")
print("-----------------------------")
```

Running your program you should see the following printed to the console.

```text
Degrees to radians conversion
-----------------------------
0.785398175
```

Note that each time the `print()` function is called the text is printed on a new line.

## Printing text and numbers

So now our program has three print commands, two that prints some text and another that prints a floating point number. Wouldn't it be nice if we could print text and numbers at the same time. This is known as **formatted output** and we can do this by putting an `f` between the opening bracket and the double quotes `"` and a variable in curly brackets `{...}`, i.e.,

```python
print(f"<some text> {variable}")
```

Edit your program so that the following print commands replace the command used to print the angle in radians.

```python
print(f"angle in degrees = {angle_in_degrees}")
print(f"angle in radians = {angle_in_radians}")
```

Running your program you should see the following printed to the console.

```text
Degrees to radians conversion
angle in degrees = 45
angle in radians = 0.785398175
```

## Format specifier

In our program the angle in radians is printed using 9 decimal places. We probably don't need this level of accuracy so lets reduce the number of decimal places outputted to 3 by editing the print commands so that they look like the following.

```python
print(f"angle in degrees = {angle_in_degrees:6.3f}")
print(f"angle in radians = {angle_in_radians:6.3f}")
```

Running your program you should see the following printed to the console.

```text
Degrees to radians conversion
-----------------------------
angle in degrees = 45.000
angle in radians =  0.785
```

Notice that the angles have now been printed using 3 decimal places. The `:6.3f` is an example of a format specifier which controls how the values of the variables are printed. Here we have told Python to print a float value that uses a total of 6 character spaces (including the decimal point) with 3 significant figures following the decimal point.

The different types of format specifiers are shown in {numref}`format-specifiers-table`.

```{list-table} Format specifiers
:header-rows: 1
:name: format-specifiers-table

* - Data type
  - Specifier
  - Python code
  - Output
* - integer
  - `d`
  - `print(f"{2:3d}")`
  - `##2` (two blank spaces followed by `2`)
* - float
  - `f`
  - `print(f"{1/3:10.3f}")`
  - `#####0.333`
* - Scientific notation
  - `e`
  - `print(f"{123456:10.2e}")`
  - `##1.23e+05` (equivalent to $1.23\times 10^{5}$)
* - String
  - `s`
  - `print(f"{'hello':10s} world")`
  - `hello###### world`
```

If the number to the left of the decimal point is zero, Python will use the smallest number of spaces required to print the number, e.g., `print(f"{1.23456:0.2f}")` will print `1.23`.

## The newline character

The newline character, `\n`, is used to instruct Python to print the rest of the string on new line. For example

```python
print("This text \nis printed\n\non multiple lines \n\n\nusing a single print command.")
```

will print

```text
This text 
is printed

on multiple lines 


using a single print command.
```

Lets print the header using a single `print()` command. Edit your program so that the first two `print()` commands are replaced by the following.

```python
print("Degrees to radians conversion\n-----------------------------")
```

Running your program you should see that the console output has not changed.

---

## Escape characters

Some characters cannot be contained within a string, e.g., `"`. To print such a character we can use an escape character which is a backslash `\` followed by the character we want to print. For example, to print

```text
The feature film "Monty Python's Life of Brian" was released in 1979.
```

we could use

```python
print(f"The feature film \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\" was released in 1979.")
```

## Exercise

````{exercise}
:label: python-basics-exercise-5

Write a program that determines the number of years, weeks, days, minutes and seconds that are in a given number of seconds. Your program should print out the result as a single sentence that mixes text and numbers. For example, if the given number of seconds is 1 million, then your program should print

```text
There are 0 years, 1 weeks, 4 days, 13 hours, 46 minutes and 40 seconds in 1000000 seconds.
```

Use your program to print the number of years, weeks, days, hours and minutes in 1 billion seconds.
