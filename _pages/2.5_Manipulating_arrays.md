# Manipulating Arrays

There may be times when you want to be able to manipulate arrays by performing actions such as appending values to the end of an array, inserting values into the middle and array or deleting elements from an array altogether. The NumPy library provides a number of functions shown in {numref}`manipulating-arrays-functions-table` to do this.

```{list-table} NumPy functions use to manipulate arrays
:header-rows: 1
:name: manipulating-arrays-functions-table

* - Function
  - Description

## Appending to an array

To append (put something on the end of) to an array we use the <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.append.html" targe="_blank">`np.append()`</a> function. The syntax for this is

```text
np.append(array, object)
```

where `object` is the thing we are appending to `array`. To demonstrate this lets append the array `[4, 5]` to the end of the array `a`. Add the following code to your program.

```python
# Manipulating arrays
print(f"a = {a}")

a = np.append(a, np.array([4, 5]))
print(f"Append [4, 5] to array a: a = {a} \n")
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Append [4, 5] to array a: a = [1 2 3 4 5]
```

When dealing with 2D arrays we need to specify which axis to which we are appending.

```text
np.append(array, object, axis)
```

If `axis = 0` then `object` is appended to the bottom of `array` and if `axis = 1` then `object` is appended to the right of `array`. To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

```python
new_matrix = np.append(A, B, 0)
print(f"Append B to the bottom of A: \n\n {new_matrix} \n") 

new_matrix = np.append(A, B, 1)
print(f"Append B to the right of A: \n\n {new_matrix} \n")
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Append B to the bottom of A: 

 [[1 2]
 [3 4]
 [5 6]
 [7 8]] 

Append B to the right of A: 

 [[1 2 5 6]
 [3 4 7 8]]
```

## Inserting into an array

To insert an object into an array we can use the <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.insert.html" target="_blank">`np.insert()`</a> function. The syntax for this is

```text
np.insert(array, index, object)
```

where `object` will be inserted into `array` starting at the `index`. Lets insert the array `[6, 7, 8]` starting at the 3rd element of `a`. Add the following code to your program.

```python
a = np.insert(a, 2, np.array([6, 7, 8]))
print(f"\nInsert [6, 7, 8] into array a: a = {a} \n")
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Insert [6, 7, 8] into array a: a = [1 2 6 7 8 3 4 5]
```

When dealing with 2D arrays we need to specify the axis.

```text
np.insert(array, index, object, axis)
```

If `axis = 0` then `object` will be inserted at the `index` row and `axis = 1` then `object` will be inserted at the `index` column. To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

```python
new_matrix = np.insert(A, 1, B, 0)
print(f"Insert B between the rows of A: \n\n {new_matrix} \n")

new_matrix = np.insert(A, 1, B.T, 1)
print(f"Insert B between the columns of A: \n\n {new_matrix} \n")
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Insert B between the rows of A: 

 [[1 2]
 [5 6]
 [7 8]
 [3 4]] 

Insert B between the columns of A: 

 [[1 5 6 2]
 [3 7 8 4]] 
```

Here `E` is formed by inserting `B` into `A` at the 2nd row and `F` is formed by inserting the transpose of `B` into `A` at the 2nd column (note that we needed to transpose the `B` array when inserting between the columns).

## Deleting from an array

To delete an object or objects from an array we can use the <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.delete.html" target="_blank">`np.delete()`</a> function. The syntax for this is

```text
np.delete(array, index)
```

where the objects located at `index` will be removed from `array`. Lets remove the numbers 7 and 8 from `a`. We want to delete the elements with indices 3 and 4 so add the following code to your program.

```python
a = np.delete(a, [3, 4])
print(f"Delete the 4th and 5th elements of a: a = {a} \n")
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Delete the 4th and 5th elements of a: a = [1 2 6 3 4 5] 
```

When dealing with 2D arrays we need to specify the axis we are deleting along.

```text
np.delete(array, index, axis)
```

If `axis = 0` then column `index` is deleted and if `axis = 1` then row `index` is deleted. To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

```python
C = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
print(f"C = \n\n {C} \n")

new_matrix = np.delete(C, 2, 0)
print(f"Delete the 2nd row of C: \n\n {new_matrix} \n")

new_matrix = np.delete(C, -1, 1)
print(f"Delete the last column of C: \n\n {new_matrix} \n")
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
C = 

 [[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]] 

Delete the 2nd row of C: 

 [[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]] 

Delete the 2nd row of C: 

 [[1 2]
 [4 5]
 [7 8]] 
```

## Sorting an array

To sort an array into ascending order we can use the <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sort.html" target="_blank">`np.sort()`</a> function. The syntax for this is

```text
np.sort(array)
```

Lets sort the array into ascending order. To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

```python
a = np.sort(a)
print(f"Sort array a into ascending order: a = {a} \n")
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Sort array a into ascending order: a = [1 2 3 4 5 6]
```

## Reshaping an array

To reshape an array (change the shape to a different number of rows and columns) we can use the <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html" target="_blank">`np.reshape()`</a> function. The syntax for this is 

```text
np.reshape(array, (rows, columns), order)
```

Lets reshape `a` so that it is a 3 $\times$ 2 array, enter the following code into your program.

```python
a_3x2 = np.reshape(a, (3, 2))
print(f"Reshape array a into a 3 x 2 array: \n\n {a_3x2} \n")
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Reshape array a into a 3 x 2 array: 

 [[1 2]
 [3 4]
 [5 6]] 
```

Here a 2D array is formed by reshaping the 1D array `a` into a $3 \times 2$ array where the elements are reshaped using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order" target="_blank">**row-major order**</a> so the first two elements `a` form the first row of of the 2D array, the next two elements form the second row of the 2D array and so on.

The other way is to use **column-major order** where the columns of the reshaped are formed by taking successive elements to from the original array. The NumPy function `np.reshape()` allows us to choose which order to use by specifying `'C'` for row-major order which is the default method or `'F'` for column-major order[^1]. To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

[^1]: The reason Python uses `'C'` and `'F'` for the row-major and column-major order is because these are the orderings used by the programming languages C and Fortran.

```python
a_3x2 = np.reshape(a, (3, 2), 'F')
print(f"Reshape array a into a 3 x 2 array (column order): \n\n {a_3x2} \n")
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Reshape array a into a 3 x 2 array (row-major order): 

 [[1 4]
 [2 5]
 [3 6]] 
```

## Exercise

```{exercise}
:label: arrays-exercise-4

Use the arrays from {ref}`python-declaring-arrays-ex` and appropriate NumPy functions to print the following:

1. $D$ appended to the right of $B$
2. The first two rows of $D$ appended to the bottom of $B$
3. $D$ inserted between the 2nd and 3rd columns of $B$
4. $B$ with the middle row removed
5. $\vec{a}$ sorted in descending order (hint: you will need to use [array slicing](array-slicing-section))
6. $C$ reshaped into an $8 \times 1$ array
```
