# Declaring functions

Functions in Python are declared using the `def` keyword.

```text
def function():
    commands to be executed
```

Where `function` is the name which is used be the program to refer to the function. A function name must begin with a character or underscore and not a number. Also care must be taken not to use the same name as a previously defined function (e.g., if you define a new function called `max` then you won't be able to use Python's built-in `max` function).

Note that the commands within the function are indented. The commands following a function that are not indented are not part of the function so functions are ended with the next non-indented command (similar to loops and if statements).

Create a new Python file called **5_Functions.py** and save it to your OneDrive folder. Lets define a function that prints `hello world` to the console. Enter the following code into your file.

```python
# =============================================================================
# 5. Functions
# =============================================================================

print("\n5. Functions\n------------")

# 5.1 Declaring a function
print("\n5.1 Declaring a function\n------------------------")

def hello():
    print("Hello world")
```

Here we have declared a function called `hello` that has no input argument (there is nothing between the brackets). The function prints the `hello world` string. Now that we have defined our function we can now **call** the function to use it. Add the following code beneath where you have declared the `hello()` function.

```python
hello()
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
5. Functions
------------

5.1 Declaring a function
--------------------
Hello world
```

```{important}
Function declarations can appear anywhere within a Python program but must appear above any calls to the function.
```

## Local and global variables

Any variables defined within a function are known as **local variables** because they can only be accessed from commands within the function. It can be useful to think of a function as a black box in that any variables which are defined within a function cannot be used outside of the function unless they have been outputted using the `return` command.

Variables that have been defined prior to the a function being called are known as **global variables** and can be access within a function, i.e., all variables defined outside of a function are global variables by default.

To demonstrate the difference between local and global variables enter the following code into your program.

```python
# 5.1.1 Local and global variables
def print_name():
    last_name = "Williams"
    print(f"Name: {first_name} {last_name}")


print("\n5.1.1 Local and global variables\n--------------------------------")
first_name = "Ellie"
print_name()
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
5.1.1 Local and global variables
--------------------------------
Name: Ellie Williams
```

Here the variable `first_name` is declared outside of the function and the variable `last_name` is declared inside the function. Both variables can be access by commands inside of the function as evidenced by the `print()` command. Lets try to access `last_name` outside of the function. To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

```python
print(last_name)
```

If you try to run your program you will see the following error message printed to the console.

```text
NameError: name 'last_name' is not defined
```

Python does not know what `last_name` is because it was declared inside of a function and is therefore a local variable. Comment out or delete this line so that your program runs ok.

## Exercise

Create a new Python file called **5_Functions_exercises.py** and save it to your OneDrive folder. Use it to answer the following exercises.

````{exercise}
:label: python-declaring-functions-ex

Write a function called `loving_it()` that outputs the following message to the console

```text
I'm writing Python programs and I'm loving it.
```
