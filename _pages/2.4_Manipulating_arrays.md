# Manipulating Arrays

There may be times when you want to be able to manipulate arrays by performing actions such as appending values to the end of an array, inserting values into the middle and array or deleting elements from an array altogether. The NumPy library provides a number of functions to do this.

```{list-table} NumPy functions use to manipulate arrays
:header-rows: 1

* - Function
  - Description
* - `np.append()`
  - Add elements to the end of an array
* - `np.insert()`
  - Insert elements into an array
* - `np.delete()`
  - Delete elements from an array
* - `np.sort()`
  - Sort the elements of an array into ascending order
* - `np.reshape()`
  - Change the number of rows and columns of an array

## Appending to an array

To append (put something on the end of) to an array we use the <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.append.html" targe="_blank">`np.append()`</a> function. The syntax for this is

```text
np.append(array, object)
```

where `object` is the thing we are appending to `array`. To demonstrate this lets append the array `[4, 5]` to the end of the array `a`. Add the following code to your program.

```python
# Manipulating arrays
print("\n2.5 Manipulating arrays\n-----------------------")
print(f"a = {a}")

a = np.append(a, np.array([4, 5]))
print(f"\nAppend [4, 5] to array a:\na = {a}")
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
2.5 Manipulating arrays
-----------------------
a = [1 2 3]

fprintf("\nAppend [4, 5] to array a:\n")
a = [a, [4, 5]]
```

When dealing with 2D arrays we need to specify which axis to which we are appending.

```text
np.append(array, object, axis)
```

If `axis = 0` then `object` is appended to the bottom of `array` and if `axis = 1` then `object` is appended to the right of `array`. To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

```python
C = np.append(A, B, 0)
print(f"\nAppend B to the bottom of A:\nC = \n{C}") 

D = np.append(A, B, 1)
print(f"\nAppend B to the right of A:\nD = \n{D}")
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Append B to the bottom of A:
C = 
[[1 2]
 [3 4]
 [5 6]
 [7 8]]

Append B to the right of A:
D = 
[[1 2 5 6]
 [3 4 7 8]]
```

## Inserting into an array

To insert an object into an array we can use the <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.insert.html" target="_blank">`np.insert()`</a> function. The syntax for this is

```text
np.insert(array, index, object)
```

where `object` will be inserted into `array` starting at the `index`. Lets insert the array `[6, 7, 8]` starting at the 3rd element of `a`. Add the following code to your program.

```python
a = np.insert(a, 2, np.array([6, 7, 8]))
print(f"\nInsert [6, 7, 8] into array a:\na = {a}")
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Insert [6, 7, 8] into array a:
a = [1 2 6 7 8 3 4 5]
```

When dealing with 2D arrays we need to specify the axis.

```text
np.insert(array, index, object, axis)
```

If `axis = 0` then `object` will be inserted at the `index` row and `axis = 1` then `object` will be inserted at the `index` column. To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

```python
E = np.insert(A, 1, B, 0)
print(f"\nInsert B between the rows of A:\nE = \n{E}")

F = np.insert(A, 1, B.T, 1)
print(f"\nInsert B between the columns of A:\nF = \n{F}")
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Insert B between the rows of A:
E = 
[[1 2]
 [5 6]
 [7 8]
 [3 4]]

Insert B between the columns of A:
F = 
[[1 5 7 2]
 [3 6 8 4]]
```

Here `E` is formed by inserting `B` into `A` at the 2nd row and `F` is formed by inserting the transpose of `B` into `A` at the 2nd column (note that we needed to transpose the `B` array when inserting between the columns).

## Deleting from an array

To delete an object or objects from an array we can use the <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.delete.html" target="_blank">`np.delete()`</a> function. The syntax for this is

```text
np.delete(array, index)
```

where the objects located at `index` will be removed from `array`. Lets remove the numbers 7 and 8 from `a`. We want to delete the elements with indices 3 and 4 so add the following code to your program.

```python
a = np.delete(a, [3, 4])
print(f"\nDeleting the 4th and 5th elements of a:\na = {a}")
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Deleting the 4th and 5th elements of a:
a = [1 2 6 3 4 5]
```

When dealing with 2D arrays we need to specify the axis we are deleting along.

```text
np.delete(array, index, axis)
```

If `axis = 0` then column `index` is deleted and if `axis = 1` then row `index` is deleted. To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

```python
G = np.delete(C, 2, 0)
print(f"\nDelete the 3rd row of C:\nG = \n{G}")

H = np.delete(D, 1, 1)
print(f"\nDelete the 2nd column of H:\nH = \n{H}")
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Delete the 3rd row of C:
G = 
[[1 2]
 [3 4]
 [7 8]]

Delete the 2nd column of H:
H = 
[[1 5 6]
 [3 7 8]]
```

## Sorting an array

To sort an array into ascending order we can use the <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sort.html" target="_blank">`np.sort()`</a> function. The syntax for this is

```text
np.sort(array)
```

Lets sort the array into ascending order. To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

```python
a = np.sort(a)
print(f"\nSort array a into ascending order:\na = {a}")
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Sort array a into ascending order:
a = [1 2 3 4 5 6]
```

## Reshaping an array

To reshape an array (change the shape to a different number of rows and columns) we can use the <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html" target="_blank">`np.reshape()`</a> function. The syntax for this is 

```text
np.reshape(array, (rows, columns), order)
```

Lets reshape `a` so that it is a 3 $\times$ 2 array, enter the following code into your program.

```python
I = np.reshape(a, (3, 2))
print(f"\nReshape array a into a 3 x 2 array:\nI = \n{I}")
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Reshape array a into a 3 x 2 array:
I = 
[[1 2]
 [3 4]
 [5 6]]
```

Here `I` is formed by reshping the 1D array `a` into a 3 $\times$ 2 array where the elements are reshaped row-by-row (i.e., the first two elements `[1, 2]` of `a` form the first row of `I`, the next two `[3, 4]` form the second row of `I` and so on). This is an example of **row-major** order which is used by programming languages such as C. The other way is to use **column-major** order where the elements are reshaped column-by-column and is used by programming languages such as Fortran.

The NumPy function `np.reshape()` allows us to choose whether we want to use column-major or row-major ordering by specifying `'C'` (for C which is the default) or `'F'` (short for Fortran) respectively. To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

```python
J = np.reshape(a, (3, 2), 'F')
print(f"\nReshape array a into a 3 x 2 array column-by-column:\nJ = \n{J}")
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Reshape array a into a 3 x 2 array column-by-column:
J = 
[[1 4]
 [2 5]
 [3 6]]
```

## Exercise

```{exercise}
:label: arrays-exercise-4

Use the arrays from {ref}`python-declaring-arrays-ex` and appropriate NumPy functions to print the following:

1. $D$ appended to the right of $B$
2. The first two rows of $D$ appended to the bottom of $B$
3. $D$ inserted between the 2nd and 3rd columns of $B$
4. $B$ with the middle row removed
5. $\vec{a}$ sorted in descending order (hint: you will need to use [array slicing](array-slicing-section))
6. $C$ reshaped into an $8 \times 1$ array
```
