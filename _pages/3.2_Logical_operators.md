# Logical operators

There are three main **logical operators** (also known as logical connectors) available in Python. These are used to combine conditional statements to form a logical argument. For example, the logical operator OR connecting two conditions $x$ and $y$ is denoted mathematically by $x \lor y$ and returns a true result if either $x$ or $y$ is true. We can illustrate all of the possible combinations of $x \lor y$ in a **truth table** as shown in {numref}`or-truth-table`.

```{list-table} Truth table for $x \lor y$
:header-rows: 1
:name: or-truth-table

* - $x$
  - $y$
  - $x \lor y$
* - 0
  - 0
  - 0
* - 0
  - 1
  - 1
* - 1
  - 0
  - 1
* - 1
  - 1
  - 1
```

Another logical operator is AND which is denoted mathematically by $x \land y$ and returns a true result only if both $x$ and $y$ are true. The truth table for $x \land y$ is shown in {numref}`and-truth-table`.

```{list-table} Truth table for $x \land y$
:header-rows: 1
:name: and-truth-table

* - $x$
  - $y$
  - $x \land y$
* - 0
  - 0
  - 0
* - 0
  - 1
  - 0
* - 1
  - 0
  - 0
* - 1
  - 1
  - 1
```

The last logical operator Python provides is the not operator which is denoted mathematically by $\lnot x$ and simply returns the opposite boolean result. The truth table for $x \land y$ is shown in {numref}`not-truth-table`.

```{list-table} Truth table for $\lnot x$
:header-rows: 1
:name: not-truth-table

* - $x$
  - $\lnot x$
* - 0
  - 1
* - 1
  - 0
```

## Python logical operators

Logical conditions can be connected using logical operators given in {numref}`logical-operators-table`.

```{list-table} Logical operators
:name: logical-operators-table
:header-rows: 1

* - Operator
  - Description
  - Python syntax
* - $x \lor y$ 
  - logical or
  - `x or y`
* - $x \land y$
  - logical and
  - `x and y`
* - $\lnot x$
  - logical not
  - `not x`
```

Lets produce a truth table for the these logical operators. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
# Logical operators
print("\n x | y | x or y | x and y | not x | not y")
print("-----------------------------------------")

x, y = 0, 0
print(f" {x} | {y} |   {x or y}    |    {x and y}    |   {not x:d}   |   {not y:d}")

x, y = 0, 1
print(f" {x} | {y} |   {x or y}    |    {x and y}    |   {not x:d}   |   {not y:d}")

x, y = 1, 0
print(f" {x} | {y} |   {x or y}    |    {x and y}    |   {not x:d}   |   {not y:d}")

x, y = 1, 1
print(f" {x} | {y} |   {x or y}    |    {x and y}    |   {not x:d}   |   {not y:d}")
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the console output.

```text
 x | y | x or y | x and y | not x | not y
-----------------------------------------
 0 | 0 |   0    |    0    |   1   |   1
 0 | 1 |   1    |    0    |   1   |   0
 1 | 0 |   1    |    0    |   0   |   1
 1 | 1 |   1    |    1    |   0   |   0
```
