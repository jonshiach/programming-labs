# Manipulating Arrays

There may be times when you want to be able to manipulate arrays by performing actions such as appending values to the end of an array, inserting values into the middle and array or deleting elements from an array altogether.

---

## Appending to an array

To append (put something on the end of) to an array we use the syntax

```text
[ array, object ]
```

where `object` is the thing we are appending to `array`. To demonstrate this lets append the array `[4, 5]` to the end of the array `a`. Add the following code to your program.

```matlab
% 9.4 Manipulating arrays
fprintf("\n9.4 Manipulating arrays\n-----------------------\n")
a

fprintf("\nAppend [4, 5] to array a:")
a = [a, [4, 5]]
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
9.4 Manipulating arrays
-----------------------

a =

     1     2     3


Append [4, 5] to array a:
a =

     1     2     3     4     5
```

When dealing with 2D arrays we can append to the right or underneath our array. To append to the right we use

```text
array = [array, object]
```

and to append underneath we use

```text
array = [array ; object]
````

To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
fprintf("\nAppend B to the bottom of A:")
C = [A ; B]

fprintf("\nAppend B to the right of A:")
D = [A , B]
```

Run your program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
Append B to the bottom of A:
C =

     1     2
     3     4
     5     6
     7     8


Append B to the right of A:
D =

     1     2     5     6
     3     4     7     8
```

---

## Inserting into an array

To insert an object into an array we can use

```text
array = [ array(1:index - 1), object, array(index:end) ]
```

where `object` will be inserted into `array` starting at the `index`. Lets insert the array `[6, 7, 8]` starting at the 3rd element of `a`. Add the following code to your program.

```matlab
fprintf("\nInsert [6, 7, 8] into the array a:")
a = [a(1 : 2), [6, 7, 8], a(3:end)]
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
Insert [6, 7, 8] into the array a:
a =

     1     2     6     7     8     3     4     5
```

We can do similar with 2D arrays. To demonstrate this lets insert the rows of `B` between the rows of `A`. Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
fprintf("\nInset B between the rows of A:")
E = [A(1,:) ; B ; A(2,:) ]
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
Inset B between the rows of A:
E =

     1     2
     5     6
     7     8
     3     4
```

Lets insert the columns of `B` between the columns of `A`. Enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
fprintf("\nInsert B between the columns of B:")
F = [A(:,1), B, A(:,2) ]
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
Insert B between the columns of B:
F =

     1     5     6     2
     3     7     8     4
```

---

## Deleting from an array

To delete an object or objects from an array we can use the syntax

```text
array(index) = []
```

where the objects located at `index` will be removed from `array`. Lets remove the numbers 7 and 8 from `a`. We want to delete the elements with indices 4 and 5 so add the following code to your program.

```python
fprintf("\nRemove the numbers 7 and 8 fron array a:")
a(4 : 5) = []
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Remove the numbers 7 and 8 fron array a:
a =

     1     2     6     3     4     5
```

When dealing with 2D arrays we need to specify the indices for the rows and columns of the elements we want to remove.

```python
fprintf("\nDelete the 3rd row of C:")
G = C;
G(3, :) = []

fprintf("\nDelete the 2nd column of D:")
H = D;
H(:, 2) = []
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the console.

```text
Delete the 3rd row of C:
G =

     1     2
     3     4
     7     8


Delete the 2nd column of D:
H =

     1     5     6
     3     7     8
```

## Sorting an array

To sort an array into ascending order we can use the `sort()` function. The syntax for this is

```text
sort(array)
```

Lets sort the array `a` into ascending order. To demonstrate this, enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
fprintf("\nSort array a into ascending order:")
a = sort(a)
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
Sort array a into ascending order:
a =

     1     2     3     4     5     6
```

---

## Reshaping an array

To reshape an array (change the shape to a different number of rows and columns) we can use the `reshape()` function. The syntax for this is

```text
reshape(array, rows, columns)
```

Lets reshape `a` so that it is a 3 $\times$ 2 array, enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
fprintf("\nReshape array a into an 3 x 2 array:")
I = reshape(a, 3, 2)
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
Reshape array a into an 3 x 2 array:
I =

     1     4
     2     5
     3     6
```

Here `G` is formed by reshping the 1D array `a` into a 3 $\times$ 2 array where the elements are reshaped column-by-column (i.e., the first three elements `[1, 2, 3]` of `a` form the first column of `G`, the next three `[4, 5, 6]` form the second row of `G`). This is an example of **column-major** order which is used by programming languages such as Fortran upon which MATLAB is based.

To reshape an array using **row-major** order we use the syntax

```matlab
reshape(array', columns, rows)'
```

So to reshape `a` so that it is a 3 $\times$ 2 array using row-major order enter the following code into your program.

```matlab
fprintf("\nReshape array a into an 3 x 2 array row by row:")
J = reshape(a', 2, 3)'
```

Run the program and you should see the following added to the command window.

```text
Reshape array a into an 3 x 2 array row by row:
J =

     1     2
     3     4
     5     6
```

## Exercise

```{exercise}
:label: matlab-arrays-exercise-4

Use the arrays from {ref}`matlab-arrays-exercise-1` and appropriate functions to print the following:

1. $D$ appended to the right of $B$
2. The first two rows of $D$ appended to the bottom of $B$
3. $D$ inserted between the 2nd and 3rd columns of $B$
4. $B$ with the middle row removed
5. $\vec{a}$ sorted in descending order
6. $C$ reshaped into an $8 \times 1$ array
```
