# Installing MATLAB

Like Python, MATLAB is also install on the PCs in the Dalton Building labs and on the fifth floor of the library building. Unlike Python, MATLAB is not open source and is quite expensive for the individual to purchase. Fortunately as a student of Manchester Met, we give you a student license free of charge so that you can install it on your own computer.
