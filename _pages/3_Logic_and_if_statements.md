# 3. Logic and If Statements

A common task in programming is to perform an operation if a particular condition is met. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture" target="_blank">Collatz conjecture</a> is a famous problem in mathematics that states that a sequence of numbers generated by the following rules applied to a starting positive integer $n$ will eventually reach 1

$$ f(n) = \begin{cases} n/2 & \textsf{if $n$ is even}, \\ 3n+1 & \textsf{if $n$ is odd}. \end{cases} $$

If we were to write a program to generate the sequence of numbers using these rules we would need an **if** statement that checks the value of the number and then invokes the appropriate commands.

## Conditional statements

Conditional statements are statements which we can use to make decisions based on its result. They return a Boolean value of either `True` or `False` depending on what condition we have applied.

```{list-table} Conditional statements
:name: conditional-statements-table
:header-rows: 1

* - Operator
  - Description
  - Python syntax
* - $=$
  - equal
  - `x == y`
* - $\neq$
  - not equal to
  - `x != y`
* - $>$
  - greater than
  - `x > y`
* - $<$
  - less than
  - `x < y`
* - $\geq$
  - greater than or equal to
  - `x >= y`
* - $\leq$
  - less than or equal to
  - `x <= y`
```

Python can also assume a numerical value of a boolean value where 1 is the same as `True` and 0 is the same as `False`. Create a new Python file called `3_Logic_and_if_statements.py` and save it to your OneDrive folder. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
x, y = 1, 2

print(f"Conditional statements\n----------------------")
print(f"{x} == {y}: {x == y}")
print(f"{x} != {y}: {x != y}")
print(f"{x} > {y} : {x > y}")
print(f"{x} < {y} : {x < y}")
print(f"{x} >= {y}: {x >= y}")
print(f"{x} <= {y}: {x <= y}")
```

Run your program and your should see the following printed to the console.

```text
Conditional statements
----------------------
1 == 2: False
1 != 2: True
1  > 2: False
1  < 2: True
1 >= 2: False
1 <= 2: True
```

### Logical operators

Logical conditions can be connected using logical operators given in {numref}`logical-operators-table`.

```{list-table} Logical operators
:name: logical-operators-table
:header-rows: 1

* - Operator
  - Description
  - Python syntax
* - $x \lor y$ 
  - logical or
  - `x or y`
* - $x \land y$
  - logical and
  - `x and y`
* - $\lnot x$
  - logical not
  - `not x`
```

Lets produce a truth table for the these logical operators. Enter the following code into your program.

```python
# Logical operators
print(f"\nLogical operators\n----------------------")

print("\n x | y | x or y | x and y | not x | not y")
print("-----------------------------------------")
x, y = 0, 0
print(f" {x} | {y} |   {x or y}    |    {x and y}    |   {not x:d}   |   {not y:d}")
x, y = 0, 1
print(f" {x} | {y} |   {x or y}    |    {x and y}    |   {not x:d}   |   {not y:d}")
x, y = 1, 0
print(f" {x} | {y} |   {x or y}    |    {x and y}    |   {not x:d}   |   {not y:d}")
x, y = 1, 1
print(f" {x} | {y} |   {x or y}    |    {x and y}    |   {not x:d}   |   {not y:d}")
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the console output.

```text
Conditional operators
----------------------

 x | y | x or y | x and y | not x | not y
-----------------------------------------
 0 | 0 |   0    |    0    |   1   |   1
 0 | 1 |   1    |    0    |   1   |   0
 1 | 0 |   1    |    0    |   0   |   1
 1 | 1 |   1    |    1    |   0   |   0
```

## If statements

If statements are used in a program to execute commands when a certain logical condition is met. The syntax of an if statement takes the following form

```text
if <condition>:
    <commands executed when true>
```

Note that the commands following the `if` statement are indented. Python assumes that the indented lines following the if statement full under the scope of the if statement which ends with the first non-indented line.

Enter the following code into your program.

```python
# If statements
print(f"\nIf statements\n-------------")
x, y = 2, 3
if x < y:
    print(f"{x} is less than {y}")
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the console output.

```text
If statements
-------------
2 is less than 3
```

## Else-if

Sometimes you want to perform calculations if the previous conditions were not true. We can do this using the if-else condition with the `elif` keyword.

```text
if <condition 1>:
    <commands executed if condition 1 is true>
elif <condition 2>:
    <commands executed if condition 2 is true>
```

Enter the following code into your program.

```python
# Else-if statements
print(f"\nElse-if statements\n------------------")
hour = 14
if hour < 12:
    print("\Good morning, how are you today?")
elif hour < 18:
    print("Good afternoon, are you having a good day?")
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the console output.

```text
Else-if statements
------------------
Good afternoon, are you having a good day?
```

## Else

The `else` keyword is used to perform calculations if all previous conditions are false.

```text
if <condition 1>:
    <commands executed if condition 1 is true>
elif <condition 2>:
    <commands executed if condition 2 is true>
else:
    <commands executed if all previous conditions are false>
```

Add the following code to the end of your if-else if statement.

```python
else:
    print("Good evening, did you have a good day")
```

Run your program and your should see the following added to the console output.

```text
Good evening, did you have a good day
```

````{exercise}
:label: if-statements-exercise-1

The degree classification for an undergraduate student at Manchester Metropolitan University is determined using by calculating a weighted average of the level 5 (2nd year) and level 6 (3rd year) unit marks using the ratio 25:75 then looking up the classification in the table below.

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Weighted average
  - Degree classification
* - $\geq 70$ 
  - first class (1st)
* - $\geq 60$
  - upper second class (2:1)
* - $\geq 50$
  - lower second class (2:2)
* - $\geq 40$
  - third class (3rd)
* - $<40$
  - fail
```

For example, a student who has gained level 5 marks of 55, 45, 75, 65 and level 6 marks of 60, 74, 72, 68 has a weighted average of 66.4 and therefore will graduate with upper second class honours.

Create a new Python file called **3_Logic_and_if_statements_exercise.py** and write a program that prints the degree classification based on the level 5 and 6 marks that are stored in two arrays. Use your program to determine the degree classification of a student who has level 5 marks of 62, 65, 72, 64 and level 6 marks of 66, 73, 77, 70. 
````

````{exercise}
:label: if-statements-exercise-2

The degree classification of a student is also determined using the profile method that only uses the level 6 marks. The average of the level 6 marks and the degree classification is found by looking up the table below.

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Level 6 average
  - together with two units marks of
  - Degree classification
* - $\geq 68$
  - $\geq 70$
  - first class (1st)
* - $\geq 58$
  - $\geq 60$
  - upper second class (2:1)
* - $\geq 48$
  - $\geq 50$
  - lower second class (2:2)
* - $\geq 40$
  - $\geq 40$
  - third class (3rd)
```

The degree classification a student receives is the higher classification of the weighted average method and the profile method. 

For example, for the same student with level 6 marks of 60, 74, 72, 68 giving a level 6 average of 68.5. Since they have 2 units with marks above 70% the classification using the profile method is first class honours.

Extend your program from {ref}`if-statements-exercise-1` so that the degree classification using the profile method is determined and the final degree classification is printed. 

Hint: The `np.sort(x)` sorts the array `x` into ascending order.
